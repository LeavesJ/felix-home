# Commissioning: the first-encounter moment, as a table.
#
# v3.2 §8 names a ten-step pipeline that runs the first time Felix binds a
# checkout, and every stage of it already existed here as a separate command
# a person had to type in the right order — felix new printed the sequence
# instead of running it, which invariant 3 calls a defect. This file is the
# moment those commands answer to. A row names a NEED, the capability it
# serves, the INSTRUMENT the question requires on this machine, a `when`
# that switches it off, the engine stage that ANSWERS it, an independent
# CHECK that decides, and the §8 step it belongs to. The engine never
# decides a row is done: the check does, after the answer ran.
#
# Five computed states, never stored. `done` and `held` are observations —
# the check said yes or no. `not-applicable` asked nothing. `unknown` is the
# state this table exists to make reachable: an instrument that is not
# installed here, a `when` or check whose command does not exist, a `when`
# that answers neither yes nor no, an engine function a check names that this
# process has not loaded, a checkout that cannot be entered, or a lookup the
# state is read from that could not be made: the declared capabilities, or the
# engine functions a check names. It blocks the receipt and nothing can
# demote it but the machine changing. `malformed` counts toward nothing and
# fails the run.
# A row whose answer is a provider — a skill a session's model runs — is a
# separate class by construction: it is `awaiting` until a file it cannot
# write appears, it holds nothing, and awaiting, stale, partial or answered it
# never decides the receipt (the first three are counted in its awaiting
# field). One whose answer could not be read is `unknown` like any row, and
# makes the receipt indeterminate.
#
# The install policy is not here. Answers call the commands that already
# hold it (stack apply --yes, ready --fix, discover --adopt) and this file
# only asks afterwards whether the check now passes.

# Run a check or a `when` in the checkout, in-process, with stdin closed, and
# return the status as the text left it: what it returned, what the shell
# ended with if it ended inside the text, or 126 when the checkout cannot be
# entered. 0 is yes and 1 is no; what any other status means is the caller's.
#
# In-process because a row may call the engine (felix_json_str,
# felix_probe_rows, cmd_bootstrap), which a fresh shell does not have. But that
# handed the row the CLI's pipefail, which no other table runner has: probes,
# obligations, setup and maintenance each start a `bash -c`, where
# `producer | grep -q x` is grep's answer. Here grep matching and leaving first
# killed the producer with SIGPIPE, and pipefail turned a line that was found
# into a miss: a done step read held, and a `when` read not-applicable and
# skipped its step. Deterministic once the producer writes more than a pipe
# holds with the match early; three seeded rows have the shape.
#
# So the row runs without pipefail, and so do the engine functions it calls,
# as six of them already do under bin/probes-check and bin/obligations-check.
# Keeping pipefail for those functions alone was built and dropped in review:
# the pipeline statuses the engine reads end, nearly all, in a grep that
# pipefail can only turn from a match into a miss, and carrying it took an
# alias per name, which changed what `type` says inside a row and stopped a row
# defining or sourcing an engine function. nounset stays, so a mistyped
# variable holds a check rather than passing it. What follows, as in a probe, is
# that a pipeline's status is its last stage's, so a check ending in a stage
# that succeeds whatever it is fed (`| tail`) cannot fail; the template says so,
# and nothing yet refuses one.
#
# Given a variable name as $3, it also says in that variable how the text
# ended: `returned`, `ended`, `unentered`, or `unasked` when its answer could
# not be read, which returns 2. The status cannot say it. On bash 3.2 an unset
# variable ends the shell running the text with 1, which is what a no returns,
# and so do `exit 1` and the engine's die. So that run writes `returned N` down
# a pipe once the eval is back, the group around it writes `ended N` once the
# run has exited, and the first line is the answer. The reader never waits for
# the pipe to close: bash marks the copy of stdout it saves around the eval
# close-on-exec, so a program the text starts does not hold it, but a job the
# text forks as a shell keeps it (measured: `{ sleep 3; :; } &` held a reader
# waiting for end of file 3 s). What the text writes to its stdout and stderr
# goes nowhere. A text that writes to that saved copy (fd 10) or answers from
# an EXIT trap can forge its answer, and nothing in its process can stop it.
# No locals, because one would hide the caller's variable of that name from
# printf -v.

# Whether a run reported every row the table lists: the same needs, in the

# in a shell of its own and returns 0 whatever became of that shell, and on
# bash 3.2 a fork that fails there (a state or class substitution, a
# provider's request, the runner) or a pipe it cannot make ends it with 128.
# The rows after that are never printed, missing rather than blank, and
# nothing inside the loop can see it. A reviewer measured a table of three
# rows giving one line, and the receipt read commissioned with the held row
# gone. So the reader counts, against the table read again. A table that lists
# nothing never has a complete run: a run that asked nothing certifies
# nothing. Prints `K of N` when the run is short or wrong, nothing when whole,
# and only the status when given a third argument: the receipt needs no more,
# and every fork it skips is one fewer place for a starved run to die.
#
# Both sides are read by the same awk. The table's side was `cut -f1` until
# review, and BSD cut under a UTF-8 locale stops at the first need holding a
# byte that is not UTF-8, so an honest run of such a table read `3 of 1` on
# every run and no rerun could clear it. awk passes those bytes through, and

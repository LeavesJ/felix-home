# Capability detection.
#
# The guidebook's later phases assume surfaces a young project does not have
# yet: no deploy target, so no preview environments; no Sentry, so no incident
# loop; no Stripe, so no billing gate. Declaring those permanently out of scope
# is wrong, because the day a Dockerfile lands the deploy phase becomes real and
# nobody is watching for it.
#
# So Felix probes for the surface instead of asking. Each probe answers one
# question: does evidence of this capability exist in the checkout right now.
#
# Detection reports. It never enables. A gate that switched itself on would
# block a pull request for a reason no one chose, and the whole doctrine here is
# that a gate's meaning has to be deliberate. `felix doctor` shows the drift;
# adopting it is a decision someone makes.

# 0 when there is no file or it was read, whether or not it holds a
# capability line, and 2 when something is there and could not be read as a
# list. Only nothing at all is absent: a link whose target is gone, a
# directory or a pipe is something there that is not a list, and is 2 without
# being opened (a pipe must not be opened at all, since a reader would wait on
# it for a writer).
#
# 2026-10-08: until then it read with grep -vE '^\s*(#|$)' in the caller's
# locale, which treated a file that is not text as a list. A NUL made BSD grep
# print "Binary file <path> matches" as the one capability (measured), and by
# GNU grep's manual (not run) stop printing at the first NUL with 0 and, under
# a UTF-8 locale, drop each line holding a byte that is not valid UTF-8; BSD
# grep reads such a byte as text. A byte-order mark before a comment listed the
# comment, a line of only a no-break space was listed in the C locale and
# dropped in UTF-8, and a CR made every name one no table holds. Now a NUL
# anywhere is no list (as #383 refused a qualification.tsv holding one), the
# file is read byte for byte in the C locale, a leading UTF-8 byte-order mark
# is dropped, and a listed line holding a byte outside tab and printable ASCII
# makes the whole file no list, the way qualify calls a row with a CR
# malformed. A file that is no list is 2 with nothing printed.
# It reads with cat into a subshell, not a redirect or a second grep, so that
# the file is opened once by a named command whose status says a read failed
# (the read builtin returns a read error as end of input). The C locale is set
# inside the subshell because bash 4 to 5.2 in a UTF-8 locale reads the byte
# after a UTF-8 lead byte as part of a character without asking whether it is
# the delimiter, so a NUL right after one hid from read -d '' (#383's review);
# the subshell keeps the locale, IFS and set -f its own, and its stderr is
# discarded as grep's was. A caller whose LC_ALL is readonly and not C gets 2
# and no message: bash 3.2 abandons the subshell at the assignment, and the
# second test refuses where a shell would carry on in the caller's locale.
# cat is `command cat`, so no function of that name stands in. The lines are
# judged by two regular expressions, each tried on known input first, since
# one that cannot be compiled returns 2 and `&&` would read that as no match.
# The cost is one process more per call than the grep it replaced, a cat and a
# subshell, measured, and linear in the file: the mark is cut by offset, the
# names kept in an array and each line matched once, because `${x#mark}`,
# string appends, `${x//tab/ }` and stripping leading space by pattern grew
# with the square of a file or a line (5.7 s for 670 KB, 17 s for one line of

# Noticing when somebody else's plugin is breaking the session.
#
# A plugin that ships hooks is a dependency on that plugin working. When one
# fails it does not fail quietly in its own corner: a PreToolUse hook that
# refuses stops the edit, and the reason surfaces as an error against the tool
# rather than against the plugin that caused it. The obvious reading is that
# the editor is broken.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. A security plugin installed on request began
# refusing every Write and Edit because it was not signed in, and the way to
# find out was to fail a dozen times and go looking. Switching it off is the
# cure and only takes effect next session, which is worth saying out loud
# rather than letting someone discover it by retrying.
#
# Claude Code records these properly, so this is reading rather than guessing:
# an attachment of type hook_blocking_error carrying hookName, hookEvent and
# the message. Read with grep at the finish line, where the count is already
# known and nothing is waiting on it.

# count <TAB> hook <TAB> message, worst first.

# ------------------------------------------------- a debt nobody recorded ---
#
# Felix has had `felix lesson` and `felix log` from the beginning, and having a
# mechanism is not the same as using it. Sixty commits were made in one day
# with an empty devlog, and the one bug repeated that day was repeated
# precisely because its first fix was explained in a commit message rather than
# in the file that gets mounted.
#
# So the discipline stops depending on memory. Not on every session — most
# sessions teach nothing, and a prompt that fires every time is one people
# learn to dismiss. Only when the gate actually caught something and nothing
# was written down since.
#
# Compared by time: if a catch is newer than every lesson and devlog entry its
# owner wrote, then something failed and nobody said what it meant. An entry
# dated after now is after nothing, so a clock set back cannot settle catches
# that have not happened yet.
#
# Whose catch, though. Every session's gate appends to the one mistakes.log a
# project has, so the file's own time is whoever wrote last. Compared whole,
# a session that had recorded its lesson was asked about a peer's failure: on
# 2026-09-25 the one that merged #339 was prompted three times over a `tests`
# catch another branch logged eight minutes after its lesson.
#
# So each row now says when it was caught and which session ran the gate, and
# only this session's rows count, each at its own second. The session is the
# owner wherever the gate stood. The branch the row names was the first attempt
# at an owner, and review found it failing open on this session's own catch: a
# session gating the branch it was handed and then making its own, gating a
# second checkout, or running checkout -B, which a reflog walk over renames and
# checkouts could not follow. A row that names no session, written by an older
# engine or by a gate typed outside every session, belongs to the checkout that
# has its branch checked out now.
#
# Not whether the row's commit is in this checkout's history. The gate records
# HEAD and gates the working tree, so that commit is often the base every
# branch shares, and a detached gate on main's tip is an ancestor of every
# branch cut after it.
#
# The caller names the conversation's sessions, space separated, because one
# conversation can hold more than one: the desktop app has been seen carrying a
# conversation on under a new id, its transcript still opening under the old.
# /clear is not that. It starts a conversation with a new id and none of the
# old one's context, so a catch made before it is left to the id that made it,
# and the conversation after it is not asked to explain what it never saw.
#
# The settling side has the same owner. The lessons and the devlog are
# project-wide, and their modification times said only that somebody wrote:
# review measured the real lessons.md gaining 5 to 16 lessons a day against 2
# to 21 catches, so a peer's lesson landed within hours of nearly any catch
# and silenced it, failing open on the very catch this is for. So an entry
# settles a catch only when the catch's owner wrote it, after it. `felix
# lesson` and `felix log` put each entry's owner in written.log
# (_felix_mem_written, lib/memory.sh), and that owner is matched the way the
# catch was found to be this session's: by the session, where the catch names
# one, and by the branch, where it names none. Where it was known by neither,
# no entry settles it. An edit by hand, a consolidation rewriting lessons.md,
# and an entry from before written.log existed name no owner, and settle
# nothing.
#
# The newest catch of each kind of owner is weighed on its own, and not only
# the newest of all. A catch naming no session is settled by anyone's entry on
# its branch, so when one lands after this session's own, a peer's lesson on
# that branch settled the lot, and review showed this session's catch going
# quiet unexplained. Rows naming no session keep coming while sessions run an
# engine older than the one that files the session, and two detached checkouts
# share the branch HEAD. The newest catch still owed is the one named.
#
# Every way of not knowing errs toward asking, as the whole file did: no
# session and no checkout, one git cannot name, or a row written before rows
# carried a time, which is taken at the file's time and aged by its own date.

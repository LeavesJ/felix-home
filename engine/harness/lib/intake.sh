# Issue intake.
#
# The guidebook's first exit criterion (p41) is "take an issue", and nothing
# read one. Felix turns an issue into the same shape felix repair produces for a
# CI failure: which files it names, what tier that makes it, what a fix will
# have to prove, and which tool this project already decided to reach for.
# Brief on stdout, scope verdict in the exit code.
#
# It supplies scaffolding and refuses to supply judgment, the same division the
# repair and incident loops take. Reading an issue is mechanical. Deciding what
# to build is not, and a script that guessed would be believed.
#
# Rendering is separated from fetching so a brief can be produced from text that
# came from anywhere: gh, a paste, a file. No integration is required for the
# loop to work, which matters because the alternative is a loop that exists only
# once somebody finishes wiring an issue tracker. It is also the only way the
# half worth testing is testable: the suite stubs no `gh` and never has.

# Which evidence rows a fix touching these paths will have to satisfy.
#
# Deliberately not felix_evidence_check: that compares a diff against the policy
# and there is no diff yet, because the work has not happened. This answers the
# forward question instead — what will this have to prove — which is the one
# worth asking before starting rather than after.

# The title of a pull request when --title gives none, and the squash subject
# felix merge falls back to when gh cannot give the pull request's own: the
# subject of the newest commit this branch made itself.
#
# It was HEAD's subject, and a branch landed by merging main in, taking the
# record and then opening the request ends on none of its own work. #395 reached
# main titled "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into
# claude/red-counts-unreached". Replayed over the sixty pull requests merged
# before this, HEAD's subject was a merge for 31 of them and a version slot or a
# suite record for 16 more. Under this rule none is a merge. Two are a record,
# each a commit that also changed tests/run, and six are a handoff section, each
# on a pull request that was itself a handoff.
#
# Three kinds of commit are passed over:
# - Merges, by --no-merges.
# - What a merge brought in, by --first-parent. A branch that merges another
#   branch's head before that one lands holds its commits, and after a squash
#   merge main never does. #404 merged carrier/unattended-pin, which carried
#   other pull requests' heads, and newest first its title would have been one
#   of their commits.
# - A commit whose every path is one the landing writes: the engine's version
#   slot, the suite's manifest and red record, and a handoff section under
#   $FELIX_HANDOFF_PENDING. They are named by path because their subjects
#   follow no one convention: test(record), test(red), chore(tests),
#   chore(version) and chore(engine) are all in the history. The first three
#   are paths in the engine's own tree, which a repository holds only if it
#   carries that tree. The last is where felix handoff --section writes, in any
#   project.
#
# A commit that touches no path is not passed over, since the landing wrote
# nothing in it. When every commit of the branch's own is the landing's, the
# newest of them is the title. When the branch made none, or the base cannot
# be read, it is HEAD's subject, as it always was.
#
# --no-show-signature on both reads, because log.showSignature prints a
# verification line that was read as a sha and left the title empty. The --
# after the title's revision, because a tracked file named HEAD makes it
# ambiguous. A range is never read as a path, so the branch's read needs none.

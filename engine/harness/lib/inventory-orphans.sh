# felix inventory's orphans: directories a repository's checkouts left behind
# that git no longer lists, for lib/inventory.sh, and which of its directories
# sit in a temporary directory. Read-only as the rest is: every git call is
# _fi_git, and find and git only list and hash.
#
# An orphan is a directory beside the worktrees whose .git file names a
# gitdir inside this repository's; or, in a directory inside the main
# worktree, a gitdir that no longer exists at all, or no .git and nothing
# tracked. Elsewhere that is no evidence: beside a checkout sit other
# projects, and a temp directory every process's scratch. Where to look is
# every directory holding a linked worktree git lists, and, since pruning
# every one of them leaves nothing listed, every directory inside the main
# worktree, untracked or ignored, whose tree holds within three levels a .git
# file naming a gitdir inside this repository's, or one gone. A directory
# holding only other repositories' checkouts is never one to look in.
#
# What an orphan holds is read as a checkout of the repository would be:
# with its own ignore files, or, lacking one at its top, the main worktree's,
# so a plain directory does not count a build tree the repository ignores.
# Ignored files are counted apart, and read up to 1 MiB each and 2000 in
# all, since an ignored directory can hold gigabytes and a file there can
# still be the only copy of something (a local settings file, a notes file
# under an ignored .claude/); what was passed over is said, so no count of
# 0 stands for files nobody read.

# The orphans into $T/orph ("path detail", - for none), the directories
# inside the main worktree that hold them into $T/scope, and, for the main
# worktree's status, the paths of its linked worktrees and orphans inside it,
# relative, into $T/nest.

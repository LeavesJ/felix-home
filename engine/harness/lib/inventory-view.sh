# felix inventory's human view: the rows lib/inventory.sh wrote, grouped for
# a person, what needs action first. --tsv, which the rows themselves are,
# never passes through here.
#
# Per repository, first what was read: one line per cover row, its facet, its
# coverage word and its detail (what the repository's default branch is and how
# old that fact is, where PR facts came from, the sessions and the chip window).
# Then a group per headline, in _FI_ORDER, and "undecided, content not landed"
# for an item whose content is known not to be, or only partly, on the default
# branch and that holds no state but live: undecided because a fact is unknown,
# or because its commits sit on another remote branch, listing every state it
# could not decide. A live item is counted live, and listed as well under
# question or blocked when it holds one: a session asking or stuck is not one to
# leave because another in the same directory is running. A row in a temporary
# directory that would be listed is listed after all of those, in the same
# order, its headline shown with its other states. Last, the counts: live,
# landed, orphans holding nothing unique, and items nothing was decided about
# but that a fact is unknown. The view reads each row's states and content
# column, and its detail only to find temp.

# The human view of $_FI_T/outv.

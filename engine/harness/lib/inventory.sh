# felix inventory: where unlanded work is, derived from disk, git and gh, and
# from the host's session records through one adapter.
#
# Work is lost before it reaches a pull request, and a landing actor sees only
# open ones. The sweep of 2026-09-24 found every stage, from edits left in
# stopped worktrees to a branch checked out twice whose idle index held a
# staged revert of the other's merge. A session that dies registers nothing,
# and SessionEnd fired for 13 of 60, so this is derived, every time.
#
# Read-only by construction. Every git call (_fi_git) takes no optional lock,
# runs no fsmonitor, shows no signature (a user's log.showSignature would run
# gpg), reads pathspecs literally (a directory named k* is not a
# glob) and fetches nothing a partial clone lacks (GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH, git
# 2.44; on an older git a partial clone is refused, not read). git is never
# asked to write: no merge-tree --write-tree, stash create, write-tree,
# update-index or fetch, and hash-object without -w or filters. git status
# runs with every configured filter driver switched off, since a clean filter
# runs on each stat-dirty file and may store what it is handed (git-lfs
# does), and with submodules compared by commit only, so no git runs inside
# one. Remote-tracking refs are taken as they stand; gh is asked `pr list`
# and nothing else, with its own state pointed into the scratch. Scratch is
# one mktemp -d outside every repository (inside a worktree it would read as
# that worktree's changes), removed on exit and on HUP, INT, QUIT and TERM;
# no here-document, which bash 3.2 backs with a file outside it. Advisory:
# nothing on the enforcing path reads it (invariant 2), and it exits 0
# unless a repository cannot be read at all, 2 on a bad argument.
#
# Everything here is git and GitHub, with lib/inventory-gh.sh (what gh says),
# lib/inventory-orphans.sh (what sits beside the worktrees) and
# lib/inventory-items.sh (one worktree, handoff sections, chips); what only a
# host's records say (live, question, blocked, chips, the session behind a pull
# request) is asked of lib/inventory-host.sh, and lib/inventory-view.sh draws
# the human view. What cannot be read prints unknown, never absent.
#
# One row per item: a worktree, an orphan, a local branch checked out
# nowhere, a remote branch no local branch covers (one at its tip or ahead of
# it) or open PR does, an open PR whose head no local branch proposes (always
# one from a fork), a chip, a pending handoff section; a branch's PR states ride
# on its own row, looked up by the name it has on origin. Whether a branch is
# the default one is told by its name, never by its upstream: a feature branch
# made with --track origin/main tracks the default branch and is not it. What
# was read of the repository is five rows of kind cover first: default, prs,
# sessions, chips, objects. States print in _FI_ORDER, the first the headline;
# landed means none holds but live and the content column says landed. A
# worktree or orphan in a temporary directory ($TMPDIR, /tmp, /private/tmp,
# /private/var/folders, or instead the colon-separated FELIX_INVENTORY_TEMP_ROOTS
# when set, which tests use) says temp in its detail and is read as any other.
# Content is on the default branch (origin/HEAD's target, else origin/main,
# else origin/master) when the branch reaches the tip, or a merged PR's head
# is the tip or descends from it, since squash merges defeat ancestry;
# otherwise each path the tip changed since its merge-base is compared with
# the default branch's blob: all equal landed, none not, some partly. That
# compares with main's current blobs, so a pushed tip read that way, when no PR
# list could settle it, is unknown, not unlanded. A dirty path compares its
# working file; a worktree's content is the worse of the two. Three gaps in the
# spec are filled: a pushed branch whose PRs all merged before its newest
# commits is unproposed, not landed; a staged revert's earlier tip must not
# descend from HEAD, or a reset --soft reads as one, and a detached worktree
# reads its HEAD's reflog; and a branch never pushed heads no PR, so under
# --no-gh its PR states are no.
#
# A worktree git lists is read only when git, asked there, names that
# directory as the top of a working tree of this repository: a directory
# whose .git file is gone would otherwise be read as the checkout enclosing
# it, and a path holding a line break is not read at all.
#
# Every fact per item is joined once, by awk, into one line of $T/items, and
# the loop only reads fields: a lookup in a bash string of a few thousand
# refs costs seconds a time on bash 3.2, and a fork per helper, minutes.

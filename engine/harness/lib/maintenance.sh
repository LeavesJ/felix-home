# Scheduled maintenance.
#
# Maintenance is the work that never has a deadline, so it never happens, and
# then happens all at once as a crisis. Putting it on a clock is the whole point
# of the guidebook's table on p10.
#
# Felix tracks what is due and refuses to lose track. It does not perform the
# routines: cleaning dead code and grouping dependency updates are judgment, and
# a script that did them unattended would produce exactly the flood of
# unreviewable pull requests the guidebook warns against.
#
# The last-run log is durable state in the project directory, committed like
# everything else, because a cadence tracked in a scratch file resets the first
# time someone works from a different machine and quietly reports everything as
# never-run.
#
# Times are stored as epoch seconds. Parsing a date back is where portability
# goes to die: BSD date wants -j -f, GNU date wants -d, and a maintenance tracker
# that only works on the author's laptop is not a tracker.

# The fifth column, and why it exists.
#
# A cadence of 0 means event-driven, and the format's own words are that such
# a row "is never reported as overdue". One governed project has carried
# `graphify  0  always  refresh the relationship map after a major merge` since
# 2026-08-19. Its graph was built that day and never again; fifteen days and
# two merges later the row still read `event`, and the founder found out by
# asking why the map was never updated. A row that can never come due is the
# lesson this project already holds — "nothing due" and "nothing is being
# checked" rendering identically — one table over.
#
# So an event row may carry a CHECK: a command run in the checkout, exit 0
# meaning "not due" and anything else meaning "due". Reality decides, not a
# clock. A check that cannot run is non-zero, so a broken check is loud rather
# than a quiet `ok`, which is the direction every verifier here fails in.
#
# Evaluated only where a checkout is known, and said so when it is not. An
# earlier draft let a checked row fall through to `event` when no root was
# given, reasoning that this "says nothing false, because it is not claiming
# the check passed, only that it was not asked". True of this function and
# false of its readers: `event` is also what an unchecked row emits, so at the
# rendering layer "nobody asked" and "there is nothing to ask" became the same
# line — and `felix pulse`, which keeps only `due`, dropped both. That is the
# graphify lesson a second time, one layer down. So the two are now different
# words, and a reader that cannot use `unchecked` at least cannot mistake it
# for a row that answered.
#
# A check that passes may also say why the work is not due although it is not
# done: a pushed branch already does it. Folding handoff sections is upkeep, so
# the row asking for it was read by every session at once, and on 2026-09-24/25
# three sessions folded overlapping sections where one could land.
# Its check now passes when a fold is in flight and prints the branch, and the
# row reads `inflight`, holding what it printed, so the session start names
# that branch instead of asking a second session to start the same fold.
#
# Only a passing check is read that way. A failing one is due whatever it
# printed: output may explain a row that is not due, and nothing a check
# prints can take a row off the due list, because a check that fails while
# saying something (an error, a line from grep) must stay loud. Dueness is the
# exit status alone, exactly as before. stderr is still thrown away.
#
# Emits, for that row: inflight <TAB> name <TAB> holders <TAB> 0 <TAB> description,
# the holders being its non-empty lines joined by "; ", a tab read as a space
# and every other control byte dropped. A holder goes into the session start's
# JSON, whose escaping knows only \\, ", \n, \r and \t, and one escape byte
# from a check made the whole hook output unreadable.
#
# A check a final filter makes unable to fail (final-filter.sh) is the same
# lesson again: the `bash -c` runs it without pipefail, so it reads `ok`
# whatever it asked and the row is never due. It is not run. The row reads
# `due` with `refused` where the reason goes, because `due` is the one word the
# hooks and pulse surface, and felix_maint_malformed says why.

# Project memory: the devlog, the lessons, the handoff.
#
# The guidebook's promotion ladder (p4) routes a one-off to the handoff, a
# recurring lesson to the lessons file, a repeated rule violation into the
# constitution, and a repeatable procedure into a skill.
#
# Most projects have none of these files, and the reason is friction rather than
# disagreement: everyone believes in a devlog and nobody opens an editor at the
# end of a session to write one. So the first job here is not analysis, it is
# making the entry one command, with the branch and commit filled in.
#
# Promotion detection is a prompt, never a conclusion. Recurrence is a hint that
# something might be a lesson; deciding whether it is durable takes judgment, and
# a tool that auto-promoted would fill the lessons file with noise and teach
# people to stop reading it. The value of a lessons file is entirely in its
# signal-to-noise, so the failure mode of writing too much is the fatal one.

# Where a memory row was written, spelled one way for every row that says so:
# a devlog header, a gate's catch, the owner of a lesson. The branch is the one
# HEAD names, which a checkout with no commit yet still has, HEAD when
# detached and ? outside git; the commit is `unborn` when there is none yet
# and ? outside git. `rev-parse --abbrev-ref` prints HEAD and then fails in a
# checkout with no commit yet, and its fallback wrote a second line into
# whatever it was part of.
#
# The branch and the commit come from felix_head_branch and felix_head_commit
# in resolve.sh, which this file already needs for felix_mem_dir. They were
# written here first, as private helpers, and moved rather than copied when
# receipt.sh turned out to hold the same defect and could not reach them: the
# reasoning went with them, and says why a fallback is assigned and never
# appended.
#
# The same defect was fixed twice at once, and the second fix gave this file a
# pair of its own again, _felix_mem_branch and _felix_mem_sha, for the owner
# rows written.log gained. One pair is kept, resolve.sh's, so a catch and the
# entry that settles it can never be spelled by two readers that drift apart;
# the guard reads a checkout's branch back through the same one
# (_felix_guard_branch, lib/guard.sh). The two pairs agreed everywhere but one
# place: on a checkout with no commit yet the commit here was `?`, as a
# directory that is no repository reads, and resolve.sh's says `unborn`,
# felix_tree_id's word for that state, which the heal of the split rows writes
# too. That one stays, so every row on such a tree is one occasion to
# felix_mem_recurring_mistakes. The guard matches a row by its branch and its
# session and never by its commit, so nothing it decides turns on which.

# it (its session, or for a catch filed under no session its branch), and
# neither file can say who that was. lessons.md is prose mounted into
# sessions and names only the day; a devlog header names the day and the

# that somebody wrote, and on a project with many sessions somebody always
# has: review measured the real lessons.md gaining 5 to 16 lessons a day
# against 2 to 21 catches, so a peer's lesson landed within hours of nearly
# every catch and silenced it. So the prose stays exactly as it was and the
# owner is written beside it.

# Regenerate the handoff from what git already knows. A handoff written by hand
# is a handoff written optimistically: it records what someone meant to have
# done. This records the branch, the head, what is uncommitted, and the command
# to pick up with.
# The one line git cannot tell you was also the one line this command erased.
# It regenerates the whole file, so anybody who filled in "what was in progress"
# lost it the next time anything ran — and the mechanical half, which git can
# reconstruct at any moment, survived. Now the note is passed in, or carried
# forward from the file being replaced.
#
# And it replaces only what it wrote. A handoff written by hand — 212,864 bytes
# of one, with no "Regenerated" line, in a memory directory another checkout's
# docs/ symlinks into — would have been truncated to about 565 bytes of git
# state by one run of this, and the next pulse commit would have buried the
# original. So a file that is neither empty (the placeholder `felix new`
# writes) nor in the generated shape is refused, with its size named, unless
# REPLACE is 1, which is what --replace passes.
#
# The write lands beside the file and is renamed over it, so a write that
# fails part way leaves the old handoff whole rather than truncated. Three
# things the redirection did for free are kept by hand:
#   - A handoff that is a symlink, or a chain of them, is written through to
#     the file at the end, each hop read relative to the link it came from.
#     Renamed onto a link, the link would become a regular file and its target
#     would go stale without a word.
#   - The mode is carried across, because a rename puts a new file in place
#     and a handoff somebody closed to other users should stay closed.
#   - The text is built before the temporary file exists, so that file lives
#     only between one printf and the rename. The git calls are the slow part
#     and the part a person interrupts, and a temporary file stranded there
#     would be committed by the next pulse.

# The fifth and sixth columns are the second it was caught and the session
# whose gate caught it. Every session on the project appends here, so the
# file's own time is whoever wrote last, and felix_guard_unrecorded needs both
# to tell this session's catch from a peer's. The session is the one the
# platform exports to the gate's shell, which a subagent's shell inherits from
# its parent; a dash when there is none, or when the id holds anything that
# could break the row. Appended last, so every reader of the first four is
# unchanged. The branch, commit and session are spelled by the same readers
# as the owner of a lesson (_felix_mem_written above), so the guard can match

#
# The append is made holding the log's lock, the one felix_mem_mistakes_heal

# anyway: a lock is there to protect rows, and one that could cost a row would
# be the defect it exists to prevent. The heal's tail recovery picks up an
# unlocked append in all but a microsecond window. The first four fields are
# byte for byte what #267 writes, and a heal passes a row of five or six
# fields through byte for byte: it joins only the split pair an older engine

# The shape of felix_commission_lock, and for its reason: mkdir is atomic

# Heal the split rows an engine before #267 left in a project's mistakes.log,

# Why on disk, and not only in the readers: templates/commissioning.tsv's
# gate_shown_failing row reads the file with `cut -f4`, and that table is an
# escape table, so its check cannot learn the split shape. And the writer
# cannot fix it, because a gate that passes writes no row: an install stuck on
# a split row stays stuck however often its gate goes green. So this runs where
# every install passes whatever the gate did: every session start, every gate,
# pass or fail, and every full commission run. The lib readers read through
# felix_mem_mistake_rows as well, because this can decline.
#
# It rewrites a memory file, so it is written to decline rather than risk a
# row. Silent, always 0, and nothing it does changes a caller's status:
#
#   - Read-only first. A missing, empty, symlinked or non-regular log, one whose
#     last byte is not a newline, and one with no pair all return here, with no
#     lock, no temporary, and the file's bytes, mode and mtime untouched. That
#     is every well-formed log in every session. A symlink is left alone
#     because a rename onto it would make the link a regular file; the readers
#     still read it joined.
#   - Then the lock. A live owner means someone is appending or healing, and
#     this leaves it to them.
#   - The inode is pinned with a hard link, and the rewrite is built from
#     exactly the bytes that link held at one moment. The result must be one
#     line shorter and three bytes longer per pair (`\n?\t?\t` out, `\tunborn\t`
#     in), and the log must still be that inode, or nothing is replaced. A
#     prototype that skipped this renamed an empty file over a log.
#   - The rename is atomic, in the same directory, and `mv` is resolved on PATH
#     like felix_mem_handoff's, which the suite relies on to land an append in
#     the middle of it.
#   - An append that landed on the old inode after the snapshot, from a writer
#     that takes no lock (an older engine in a session not yet restarted, or a
#     person's >>), is still on the pinned inode, and is copied onto the end of
#     the new file. What remains is only an append opened on the old inode
#     before the rename and written after the last read of it, and only for a
#     writer that takes no lock. This engine's writer takes it.
#   - The mode is carried across as felix_mem_handoff carries it, and the mtime
#     is restored from the pinned inode, because felix_guard_unrecorded reads
#     it: a row written before rows carried their second, which every healed
#     row is, is taken to have been caught at the file's time. A heal that
#     bumped it would make every such catch newer than every entry written
#     before the heal, and have the Stop hook announce a failure nobody had in
#     this session.
#
# No trap: cmd_commission owns an EXIT trap and a function that set its own
# would clobber it, so every path below cleans up after itself. The engine's
# own temporaries a killed heal left, over a minute old, are cleared while the
# lock is held. They are never memory, so this is not deleting a memory root.

# What the gate keeps catching. A far better promotion signal than counting words:
# a check that fails repeatedly is a habit, and a habit is what a lesson is for.
#
# Emits `occasions<TAB>term<TAB>last-seen<TAB>runs`, heaviest first, and only
# for terms that are still recurring.
#
# Two numbers because they answer two questions and only one of them earns a
# promotion. `runs` is how many gate runs the check cost — a fact about time
# spent. `occasions` is how many DISTINCT trees it was caught on, which is the
# only one of the two that means "again".
#
# The threshold reads occasions. A tree gated five times without being fixed
# cost five runs and recurred once, and this list's rank in `next.sh` is the
# one that tells a person to write a lesson — advice that asks them to
# generalise from a single incident. Felix's own log had `ecosystem` five
# times, every one of them the same branch at the same sha, sitting in "already
# cost time more than once" beside `installed` at twenty-two separate commits.
# The rule of three this project already holds is about occasions, not
# attempts.
#
# The count is for all time and the liveness test is not, because they answer
# different questions. "It has cost time twice" is a fact about history and does
# not expire. "It is costing time" is a fact about now, and only the second one
# earns a place in a ranked list. Felix's own log had `installed` nine times,
# every one of them before the two mechanisms that address it landed, and it sat
# at the rank `next.sh` calls the strongest promotion signal there is — above
# whatever was actually costing time that day. Nothing would ever have removed
# it: an append-only log has no way to say a thing was dealt with. A permanent
# row at the top rank is not a strong signal, it is a list people stop reading.
#
# Fourteen days rather than the seven `felix_guard_unrecorded` uses, because
# that one fires unprompted in a session and this one is read on request. The
# window errs long on purpose: a fix a few days old has not yet had the chance
# to fail, and dropping it early would be this project's own overclaiming
# failure — converting "nobody has caught it again yet" into "it is fixed".

# Whether the lessons file holds a lesson about a check of this name.
#
# This was a substring search over the whole file, and the terms it is asked
# about are gate check names that are also ordinary English words. `installed`
# matched "executing the installed hooks by hand" and "cannot be uninstalled",
# neither of which is a lesson about the `installed` check — so a check nobody
# had written anything about read as one whose lesson was being ignored. The two
# cases lead opposite ways: write the prose, versus stop writing prose because
# it is not working and build the mechanism instead. Sending someone to build a
# mechanism on the strength of a coincidence is the more expensive direction.
#
# A check named in prose is written as code, because that is what it is, and the
# house style for that is backticks. That is what separates "`installed` check"
# from "the installed hooks". Matching a following `-`, `_`, `.` or `/` means
# `secret` finds `secret-scan` and `tests` finds `tests/run`: a lesson about the
# file a check runs is a lesson about the check.
#
# The slash was missing at first, and it mattered more than the others, because
# a check name is most often written as the head of a path. Two of Felix's own
# seven gate checks — `tests` and `memory` — read as "no lesson mentions it"
# against a lessons file that discusses `tests/run` and
# `memory/verification.log` at length, and the advice that follows a false
# negative here is to write prose that is already written.
#
# It can still be wrong, and the direction it is wrong in matters. An unquoted
# mention of a real lesson reads as no lesson and asks for one to be written —
# a duplicate paragraph. The old failure sent you to build machinery you did not
# need. Prefer the cheap mistake.

# Unattended work runs only in the bound project's OWN checkout.
#
# THE RULE, AS A CLASS. Work that runs with nobody present (started by a hook,
# or by a child a hook detached) in a checkout, or that runs a tool whose
# behaviour depends on the checkout's files, runs only when the checkout is the
# bound project's own: its binding is corroborated by something the tree cannot
# choose.
#
# WHY. A checkout is bound to a project by its .felix marker first and by a
# substring of its origin second (felix_resolve_project). The marker is a file
# of the tree, so a repository's authors choose it, and a project's name is
# public: a repository opened on this machine to hunt for bugs can ship a .felix
# naming a governed project and be bound to it. The binding is right for what a
# person is present for (context, deny rows, the gate, the Stop hold) and it is
# left exactly as it was. What it must not unlock is the work nobody watches: the
# commissioning pipeline, which evals the project's table in the checkout and
# runs installers; the graph refresh, which points graphify at the checkout's
# files; tidying, which deletes files in it; and adoption, which writes the
# project's durable tables from what an unowned tree contains.
#
# THE CORROBORATION is the checkout's origin remote, parsed (felix_remote_github_slug)
# and compared as owner/repo on github.com, exactly, with the project's
# project.json remote_match (felix_checkout_is_own). Not a substring: today's
# resolution step 2 is one, and `git@evil.example:Owner/repo.git` and
# `Owner/repo-fork` pass a substring test. A .felix marker never corroborates. A
# project with no usable remote_match has no own checkout, so nothing runs
# unattended for it in any checkout. Only 0 lets the work run; unknown (git could
# not answer) is withheld like not-own.
#
# A SUBMODULE IS NEVER OWN. A plain clone's origin is the URL a person cloned
# from, which the tree cannot choose. A submodule's origin is written by git from
# the superproject's tracked .gitmodules, so the superproject's authors choose
# it, and any project whose GitHub repo they can fork or open a pull request
# against can be named: the gitlink commit only has to be fetchable from there.
# So a checkout that has a superproject is not own whatever its origin reads
# (felix_checkout_is_own, why `submodule`). A linked worktree made with
# `git worktree add` from inside a submodule shares its gitdir and so its origin,
# and git reports no superproject for it, so it is NOT refused; making one is a
# person's act on a repository they already hold, and it is not claimed here.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DEFEND. A checkout whose .git directory itself came from an
# attacker (a tarball with .git in it) controls its own config, its own origin and
# the code git runs from it, and that is out of Felix's reach and not claimed here.
#
# The gates sit at the session-start call sites, except commissioning, whose
# gate is inside felix_commission_resume_bg because that function has no
# attended caller and its refusal is written to the log it already keeps. The
# libraries the gates sit in front of (tidy, graph refresh, adoption) are
# unchanged, because attended callers and tests reach them too.

# Sourced by path because the suite sources libraries alone, in subshells, and a
# call that resolved to nothing would degrade to running nothing (house pattern).

# commissioning gives up quietly — which is the right answer, where two writers
# appending to one manifest is not.
#
# Refusals before it starts, and each is a different question; all are silent.
#   - Is it granted at all.
#   - Does the grant still cover the table on disk? An ordinary edit to
#     commissioning.tsv must not inherit a person's consent, because two of its
#     columns are eval'd.
#   - Is there a table to run.
# And then the one this file is about: is the checkout the project's own? If
# not, the run is withheld, with a refused-not-own line in the log it already
# keeps and the kind recorded for the session's one line. That is the only
# refusal that is not silent, because it is the only one a person would want to
# find out about: a grant was current and a checkout asked for the run.
# `felix commission` typed by a person is not refused anywhere: a person present
# is the consent.

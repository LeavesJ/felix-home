# What each moment has to answer for, and what nothing answers yet.
#
# Written after a failure of method rather than of code. A governed project's
# security audit found five things four days before its launch; Felix was
# handed the list and grew a command with checks for the two that were
# mechanizable — a stray listener, a file mode — and silently dropped the
# third, a missing request ceiling. Not because the check was hard. Because
# there was no table of what a deploy moment must answer, so nothing could
# say a question had gone unasked. A list of checks cannot report the check
# nobody wrote.
#
# The fix is not a better list, and this is the part worth holding on to.
# `lifecycle.tsv` already solves exactly this shape for hook events, and it
# does not work by being well written: `felix_coverage_events` reads what the
# PLATFORM actually binds, the table carries only stances, and the gap is
# whatever reality has that the table does not. That is why it named
# SubagentStop without anybody thinking of SubagentStop.
#
# So the rule here, and it is the whole design:
#
#   Felix may hold stances. Felix may never author the enumeration.
#
# Items come from two sources it does not control — what the checkout HAS
# (capabilities, read off the tree by detection) and what has actually BITTEN
# (the distinct checks in mistakes.log, written by gate failures as they
# happened). Both grow without anybody deciding they should.
#
# A stance is judgement: at which moment this item is answered, and by what.
# It is authored, arguable, and recorded, which is precisely what an
# enumeration must not be. An item with no stance is not an error and not a
# defect — it is the product. On a project that has never taken one, this
# reports every item, which is the output that would have named the request
# ceiling on the first day rather than after the audit.

# Moments a person has declared. Data, not code: the set is a table so that
# adding one is an edit rather than a release.

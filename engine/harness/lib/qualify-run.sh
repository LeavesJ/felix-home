# Throw one row's scratch tree away: the worktree, its registration in the
# root's repository, and the directory mktemp made to hold them.
#
# Until 2026-10-01 this was `git worktree remove --force` and `rmdir`, and a
# mutation beat both several ways. Each step below closes one, measured on
# git 2.54 and bash 3.2:
#
#   - `mkdir d && touch d/f && chmod a-w d`, a control with every reason to
#     stage an unwritable file, left git unable to unlink d/f: the remove
#     failed, the rmdir failed, the checkout stayed. A retry cannot mend it,
#     since git drops the registration on its way out of a failed remove. So
#     every directory short of the owner's rwx gets it back first, before git
#     runs; deleting needs the bits on the directory, not on the file. The
#     base first, by name, since find cannot search a starting point left
#     without x; then the rest one at a time from the top, so a 000 one is
#     opened before find reads it. Only directories: a file's mode is its
#     inode's, and a hard link a mutation made (`git clone . sub` makes them
#     of the root's objects) would carry chmod outside the base. find follows
#     no symlink, and no user can hard-link a directory. A directory deeper
#     than PATH_MAX is past chmod's reach, and is left and said.
#   - A scratch tree or a base swapped for a symlink is unlinked, never
#     followed: `git worktree remove` resolves the path it is given, and
#     through a link to another worktree of the root it deleted that
#     worktree, uncommitted work and all. The base gets its bits back before
#     the tree's link is unlinked, and a link that is still there afterwards
#     stops the drop, said: nothing is handed to git or rm through it.
#   - A base the mutation took away is made again, empty, so that $base/w
#     resolves to the path git registered.
#   - -f twice, so a tree the mutation locked is removed too.
#   - A remove git refuses (the tree's .git is gone) is tried again once the
#     directory is: git removes a registration whose directory is missing.
#
# Then the base goes whole: the column stderr file and whatever a mutation
# wrote beside the tree are the runner's own. Its owner record goes last
# (_felix_qualify_unown), so a base this cannot empty, or a drop killed half
# way, still names a process a later run's sweep can judge. Those steps, and
# the rm of a tree git would not remove, act inside the base, entered and
# checked to be the base itself (_felix_qualify_in): a base swapped for a
# symlink after the check above, by a process the row left running, is never
# followed into, where a glob through its name emptied the link's target
# (review 2026-10-01). What is still
# there after all that is said, on stderr, from what is there and not from an
# exit status: the base on disk, or the tree still in git worktree list.
# Nothing is pruned beyond this row's entry; other entries are not the
# runner's.
#
# What it cannot reach: a process the mutation left running, which can write
# into the base after this has removed it.

# The traps that throw a row's tree away when the row is stopped, set in the

# waits on returns: measured 2026-10-01 on bash 3.2, a caller's TERM trap ran
# six seconds late, after the row had finished. The row's process is in the
# process group that a terminal's Ctrl-C, timeout and a tool's kill all
# signal, and it carries the CLI's command line, so a kill by pattern reaches
# it too. The trap runs once the column in flight has ended: at once when the
# signal went to the group and the column does not catch it, and otherwise at
# the column's own end. Then the tree goes, no later column runs, and the row
# exits 128+N.

# It ignores the three first: a child inherits an ignored signal, so a second
# Ctrl-C cannot cut git off half way through the tree. And it prints
# unrunnable, because a row loop that was not signalled itself is still
# reading, and a row that printed nothing was counted held, a claim about a
# checker that never finished. PIPE is ignored for that one write: when the
# loop is gone, the write fails rather than ending the row with SIGPIPE.
#
# What no trap reaches. SIGKILL. And a signal sent to the CLI's process alone,
# which leaves the row to run to its end and throw its tree away there, as
# every row always has. Without a trap, TERM and HUP ended the row where it
# stood (a group INT did not, on bash 3.2: the row went on and removed its

# Run one row: a real worktree of HEAD, the mutation applied to it, the checker
# run in it, the tree thrown away.
#
# A worktree rather than a copy, because a checker may read git — history, what
# is tracked, what is ignored — and a bare directory of files would make every
# such checker fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the mutation. It
# shares the object store, so this costs a checkout and not a clone.
#
# Each column runs in a bash of its own (_felix_qualify_sh). Until 2026-09-25
# each was an eval in the caller's process, which for felix qualify and felix
# gate is the felix CLI and its set -uo pipefail. Under pipefail
# `producer | grep -q x` fails with x present: grep leaves at its first match
# and the producer dies of SIGPIPE, 141, certain past a pipe's 64 KB with the
# match early and load-dependent below it, as bash 3.2's printf writes a
# multi-line value one write() per line. So a premise read unrunnable, or,
# negated, applied its control where its premise is absent; a mutation's &&
# chain stopped short and a pass control was met over a change the checker
# never saw; a command read fail, which on a fail control is met, exactly what
# a working checker says, or in the schema rows' negated shape pass, a false
# held. nounset stopped a row at a name it never set, with exit 1, the same
# ways.
#
# A fresh bash also sees none of the engine's functions or variables, and for
# qualification that is right. The checker under test is the one in the tree
# the mutation changed, engine/harness/bin/* as the mutation left it, run as a
# process of its own that sets its own options. An engine function a row named
# would be the installed engine's code, which no mutation reaches, so the row
# would qualify the wrong code.
#
# Whatever the header says is heard, _felix_qualify_sh returns as 127, save a
# final 126, which it returns as it is. Read by its status, a command that ran
# no checker was fail, met on every fail control, the dangerous direction again,
# and a mutation that made no change left its pass control met over nothing, so
# no command runs after one. In a fresh bash an engine function is command not
# found, as is a checker path with a typo; 126 is a file that is not executable,
# or a tree that could not be entered. In a pipeline, an if, or behind ! or ||,
# the final status hides a name not found, and bash -n does not look inside
# $( ), backticks or eval, so the column's stderr goes to a file beside the
# tree and is scanned. Only the column's own shell prints under the $0 it is
# given; a checker's messages carry its path. A stderr that cannot be read
# reads as nothing run, and the helper removes the file before it returns.
# Every other status keeps its meaning.
#
# That file sits beside the tree, where a mutation can reach it as ../err,
# so each column makes it new before it runs (_felix_qualify_errfile). A
# redirection that fails runs nothing and returns 1, which on the command
# reads fail, met on a fail control: `chmod -R a-w ..` did that with the
# checker never run. And a 2> follows a link, so `ln -s $OUT ../err` sent
# the next column's stderr into a file outside the base. A file that cannot
# be made new, plain and empty, is a column that ran nothing. Both ends are
# opened on it before the column runs, 8 to write and 9 to read, and the
# column gets 8 as its stderr and neither descriptor besides. So a link or a
# fifo the column puts in the file's place changes neither what the scan
# reads nor the verdict, and grep cannot be left waiting on a fifo; what the
# column writes into the file through the path is the hidden-stderr case
# above. An end that will not open leaves said at 2, a column that ran
# nothing, with bash's own line about it. The write end is 8>|, since a
# caller's noclobber would refuse to write over the file just made.
#
# The parse and the row run without SHELLOPTS or BASHOPTS, which carry the
# caller's set and shopt options into a child bash, BASH_ENV, whose file a
# child bash runs first, or POSIXLY_CORRECT, whose posix mode before bash 5.1

# The sweep of checker qualification: the scratch trees a killed run left,
# found and removed by a later run, and nothing else touched.
#
# Each row of qualification.tsv runs in a base mktemp makes under TMPDIR,
# felix-qualify.XXXXXX, holding a worktree of HEAD at w that is registered in
# the user's repository (_felix_qualify_one, lib/qualify-run.sh). The row
# throws it away at its end, and its traps do on INT, TERM and HUP. No trap
# reaches SIGKILL: kill -9, or a tool's TERM-then-KILL. Three trees from runs
# killed that way were found in the founder's checkout on 2026-09-25, on disk
# and still in git worktree list. So each row first writes down which process
# owns its base, and each run, before its first row, removes the bases whose
# owner is shown dead, then the registrations whose base is gone.
#
# Several sessions share one TMPDIR, and their runs are alive. So every step
# below decides toward leaving a base:
#
#   - Only TMPDIR, as the row's template names it: T is ${TMPDIR:-/tmp} with
#     one trailing slash taken off. git records a tree's physical path, and on
#     macOS /var/folders/... is registered as /private/var/folders/...
#     (measured), so a registration matches T as given or as pwd -P says.
#   - A candidate is exactly what a row makes: named felix-qualify. and six
#     letters or digits, a directory and no symlink (never followed), the
#     user's own, holding owner as a symlink whose text is a record a row
#     writes, `<pid>` or `<pid> <start>` with one space (_felix_qualify_me).
#     A base from an older engine (tmp.*), a base with no record, a record in
#     a regular file, and any other text are left. A base whose owner cannot
#     be read, its search bit gone, is left.
#   - Dead only when shown dead. kill -0 that fails saying No such process,
#     under LC_ALL=C; any other failure is a process that exists (Operation
#     not permitted is another user's, pid 1 among them, measured on bash
#     3.2.57), and a message lost to a fork that failed is not a death. Or the
#     process exists, the record has a start, and its start now is another:
#     the pid is another process's now. A record with no start, or a start
#     that cannot be read now, is judged by kill -0 alone. On Linux the start
#     is read from /proc and names the pid namespace, and a record of another
#     namespace is alive (_felix_qualify_since).
#   - Then the base gets its owner's rwx back, since a dead row's mutation may
#     have taken the write bit that a claim needs. That is the only mode a
#     sweep ever changes on a base it has not claimed, and only on one it has
#     judged dead. It is changed on the directory entered, never by name.
#   - The claim, because two runs starting together both judge the same dead
#     record. Only symlink(2) and rename(2), each checked after
#     (_felix_qualify_claim): this sweep's own record linked at claim, which
#     one sweep alone can make; owner checked to read the very text judged
#     dead; claim renamed over owner. owner is never moved, so it never goes
#     missing: a sweep killed before the rename leaves a claim naming itself,
#     dead, which a later sweep breaks, and one killed after leaves owner
#     naming itself, dead, and a later sweep takes the base over. The sweep
#     that does not hold claim leaves the base without a word. All of it
#     from inside the base, entered and checked, following no name in it: ln
#     -n at a name never taken, and mv with the flag (-h or -T, asked of mv)
#     that renames onto a symlink rather than into its directory. Where mv
#     takes neither, nothing is claimed and every base is left.
#   - The drop is the row's own, _felix_qualify_drop, with the root this
#     sweep was given: the tree, its registration when this root holds it,
#     and the base, its record last. It says, as it always has, only what is
#     really left; a base it cannot empty keeps a record, so each later run
#     tries again and says again that it is left.
#   - Orphans: a registration in this root of exactly <T>/felix-qualify.<six>/w
#     whose base is neither there nor a symlink, from a base swept by another
#     repository's run, or by a run of this root whose drop lost the
#     registration. One `git worktree remove -f -f` of that path each, which
#     removes a registration whose directory is gone (measured, rc 0 on git
#     2.54). Never `git worktree prune`: it removes every stale entry, and
#     other sessions' and the user's own are not Felix's.
#
# It prints nothing on stdout, which the row loop's verdict lines own, and no
# line of its begins with two spaces, which felix gate counts rows by. It
# changes no verdict, count or status.
#
# What it cannot reach:
#   - A base made before this: a tmp.* name, or a felix-qualify.* base with no
#     record.
#   - A run killed between mktemp and its record: an empty base, no record.
#     And a drop or a sweep killed between removing the record, the base's
#     last entry, and the rmdir: an empty base, no record, no tree.
#   - A base whose owner cannot be read, because the row's mutation took the
#     owner's read or search bit off the base and the row was then killed.
#   - A base in another TMPDIR; only a later run under the same one sees it.
#   - A row whose own mutation removes or rewrites ../owner, which same-user
#     code can do and nothing here can stop. Removed, that row's tree is never
#     swept if it is killed. Forged dead, a concurrent sweep may drop the live
#     row's tree under it, and that row then reads unrunnable.
#   - Another repository's registration of a base swept here from disk. That
#     repository's own next sweep removes it as an orphan.
#   - A TMPDIR shared between machines, or between a macOS host and a Linux
#     container: a record of the start ps prints, or of a pid alone, names a
#     pid of another machine there, and a sweep on this one may read it
#     dead. Linux records name their pid namespace and are judged in it
#     alone; a record of a pid alone, where /proc could not be read, is
#     judged by kill -0 alone in any namespace.
#   - Rarer interleavings than two sweeps on one base, such as three and a
#     kill inside the claim, may let two sweeps drop the same dead base. No
#     live row's tree is reached that way: only a record judged dead is ever
#     claimed.

# The letters and digits of a base's six, spelled out: a range in a bracket

# The claim on a base whose record was judged dead: 0 when this sweep alone

# sweep took, and one that moved a record aside could lose the only copy of
# it to another's drop (review 2026-10-01).

# The lock is a second link, claim, made by one symlink(2), which fails when
# the name is taken, so no two sweeps hold it at once. Held, this sweep

# never nothing. A claim held by a sweep shown dead is broken: renamed aside
# to a name carrying this sweep's pid, checked to be the very text judged

# and every rename is given mv's flag that renames onto a symlink to a

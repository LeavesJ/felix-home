# Reach, the read: `claude mcp list` run once, and parsed into server rows.
#
# Sourced by lib/reach.sh, which classifies what this reads against a project's
# declared plugin and mcp rows (the head of that file says why none of it may
# ever sit on the enforcing path). This file holds the one place Felix runs
# `claude mcp list` for reach, and the rules for where it may run.
#
# A detail never carries a URL's query string, which can hold a key: the target
# column of a list line is never copied, and the status text is cut before its
# first question mark. It is not truncated by bytes, because a byte cut can
# split a multibyte character and one bad byte empties a macOS UTF-8 sort.
#
# THE LIST IS READ FROM AN EMPTY DIRECTORY, NEVER THE CHECKOUT. `claude mcp list`
# starts the servers it lists, a project-scoped one included once it is approved
# or auto-enabled (enableAllProjectMcpServers), and this runs at every session
# start of every governed project, repositories opened to hunt for bugs among
# them. Measured 2026-10-12 with the real CLI: a server pending approval is
# listed and not started, so reading in the checkout was safe only while Claude
# Code's approval state held; from an empty directory it is not listed at all,
# but the CLI walks up to a parent's .mcp.json, so a scratch directory with one
# above it is refused. felix_reach_read makes a fresh directory under TMPDIR
# (never the checkout, never $HOME, itself a repository here), reads from there,
# removes it, and when it cannot reads nothing, never in the caller's directory.
# A server only a project's .mcp.json declares is not seen: unknown, not not-listed.
#
# AND TMPDIR MUST BE A DIRECTORY NOBODY ELSE CAN WRITE. The first version fell
# back to /tmp, and checking for a .mcp.json above the scratch directory does not
# make that safe: /tmp is world-writable (sticky stops a delete, not a create),
# so another local user can plant /tmp/.mcp.json after the check and before the
# read, and the CLI then finds it from the parent. A check cannot close a race;
# a place where no one else can write can. So the scratch directory is made only
# under a TMPDIR that is absolute, owned by the user with no group or other write
# bit, with every ancestor up to / owned by root or the user and writable by
# neither group nor others (read on the physical path, so a symlink is judged by
# where it leads). Anything else, an unset or relative TMPDIR included, runs no
# claude: unknown, with the sentence that says why. macOS's per-user temporary
# directory passes; a Linux machine whose TMPDIR is unset or under /tmp does not,
# and reads unknown until TMPDIR names a private directory. Other processes of
# the same user are not a boundary here, and an ACL granting someone else write
# is not read.

# Sourced by path because the suite sources libraries alone, in subshells, and a
# call that resolved to nothing would degrade to saying nothing (house pattern).

# Reach: whether the MCP servers a project declares actually connect.
#
# felix stack plan calls a plugin row present once `claude plugin list` names
# it, and has never asked whether the servers that plugin ships connect. Measured
# 2026-10-12: one plugin declared `always` in eight projects was listed as
# needing authentication in a live session while `claude mcp list` from an empty
# folder said Connected; another fails every session with ENOTFOUND on a
# placeholder address; a third fails with HTTP 400. Nothing reported any of it.
# This reads `claude mcp list` once and says, per declared plugin or mcp row and
# per server, connected, needs-auth, failed, not-listed, no-server or unknown.
#
# ADVISORY ONLY, and that is the whole safety argument. The bash-and-git rule of
# invariant 2 holds because nothing on the enforcing path waits on or reads this
# result. The SessionStart hook only starts a refresh, detached, and never reads
# what it writes; the gate, the Stop hook, commissioning and felix stack plan
# never read the cache. felix stack plan keeps reading `claude plugin list` and the
# mount test in lib/stack.sh, so a plugin whose server needs authentication is
# still present there. A slow, failed or absent read costs the person a stale
# line in the pulse and nothing else; it never blocks, holds, installs, or
# changes an existing decision. The only readers of the cache are felix stack
# --reach, the pulse's report (lib/pulse.sh) and felix status (lib/status.sh),
# and each reaches it through the functions here.
#
# Unknown never reads as fine. A list that could not be read (no claude CLI, a
# failed run, a substitution that could not make its pipe, nothing printed) is
# not an empty list: it would turn every declared server into not-listed. A
# plugin with no installed directory is unknown, not no-server, because whether
# it ships a server cannot be told from disk. Every age is read from the cache's
# own header epoch and never from the file's mtime, so a copied or touched file
# cannot look fresh.
#
# The read itself (the parse of `claude mcp list`, and where it may run) is in
# lib/reach-read.sh, sourced below. It reads the list from a directory nobody
# else can write and never from the checkout, and a list it could not read is
# unknown. A detail never carries a URL's query string.
#
# Cache: <home>/state/reach/<project>.tsv, first line `# read <epoch> <dir>`
# (dir is the empty directory the read ran in, gone by now), then the rows
# felix_reach_rows printed, written to a temp file and moved into place, and
# only when the list was read: a failed read leaves the old cache.
# Each row is `state<TAB>kind<TAB>declared name<TAB>server<TAB>detail`.

# Sourced by path because the suite sources libraries alone, in subshells, and a
# call that resolved to nothing would degrade to saying nothing (house pattern).

# Human setup steps.
#
# Some things Felix cannot do and should not pretend to: creating a Sentry
# account, completing an OAuth consent screen, entering a payment method,
# holding a live API key. Those are not gaps in the harness, they are the
# boundary of what an agent should touch.
#
# The failure mode worth designing against is not "Felix cannot do it." It is
# "Felix cannot do it and nobody wrote down what to do instead," which is how a
# half-provisioned environment sits broken for a week because the one person who
# knew was not asked.
#
# So every human step is declared with a check that proves whether it is done.
# The list is derived, never hand-maintained: finish the step and it disappears
# on the next run. Same principle as capability detection, pointed at people.

# {{REPO}} is filled in when a row is read, never when it is written (G5.1,
# U19).
#
# felix new and adopt used to splice the slug in as they wrote, and with no
# GitHub remote the slug is empty: the saved check read `gh label list --repo
# 2>/dev/null`, failed forever, and counted as a step to do, so commissioning's
# human_steps was held on every repository created before its remote, which is
# every repository `felix new` is run in first. Adding the remote later changed
# nothing, because adopt skips an id that exists. Now the file keeps the
# placeholder, and the remote the checkout has today decides what it reads.
#
# What that remote says is one of three things, kept apart because they owe
# different things:
#
#   slug    origin is GitHub and names one owner/name, which is filled in;
#   unread  origin is GitHub, or looks like it, and Felix cannot read one
#           owner/name from it; or no remote is named origin and another one
#           looks like GitHub;
#   none    no remote looks like GitHub at all, or there is no remote.
#
# Only `none` lets a row wait. The first cut read every remote it could not
# turn into owner/name as no remote at all, so an ssh host alias, ssh over port
# 443, a trailing slash, or a GitHub remote not named origin read "waits for a
# GitHub remote" in a repository that had one. The label and the CI secret then
# dropped out of human_steps' count, and commissioning released a step the
# person still owed: a silent false pass. An `unread` row is a step to do, and
# says why Felix cannot check it, so it holds and is seen. The engine before the
# first cut read those rows todo as well, held but unexplained.

# One remote URL -> `slug <owner/name>`, `host <host>` when the host looks like
# GitHub and is neither github.com nor an ssh alias for it, `path` when it is
# GitHub and the path is not one owner/name, and nothing when it is not GitHub.
#
# Parsed here rather than by felix_repo_slug, whose sed strips through the
# first `github.com[:/]` and so reads ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/o/r as
# `443/o/r` and keeps a trailing slash. Its other readers are left as they are.
# The forms git takes are scheme://[user@]host[:port]/path, and scp-like
# [user@]host:path with no slash before the colon; anything else is a local
# path. Trailing slashes and a final .git are spelling, not the name.
#
# github.com, www.github.com and ssh.github.com are GitHub. Any other host in
# an ssh form may be an alias from the person's ssh config, the usual way to
# keep two GitHub accounts' keys apart, and `ssh -G` says what it stands for: it
# prints the configuration ssh would use, reads only local files, and connects
# to nothing. CanonicalizeHostname is turned off on its command line, which wins
# over the config file, because canonicalising is a DNS lookup. A Match exec
# line in that config does run, as it does on every fetch the person makes.
# Without ssh, the alias is read as written.
#
# The host has to be a plain hostname before ssh is handed it, so a remote
# cannot pass an option; and the owner/name is spliced into a command bash
# runs, so it is accepted only in the shape a GitHub owner/name has. A remote
# carrying shell text is `path`, and nothing from it runs. A host that is still
# not GitHub but has "github" in its name (an alias ssh could not resolve, a
# GitHub Enterprise server) is `host`: probably owed, and not something
# `--repo owner/name` on github.com would check.

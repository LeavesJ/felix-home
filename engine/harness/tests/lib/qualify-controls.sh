# tests/lib/qualify-controls.sh: what the qualify parts share from the part that
# arms the gate on a declared control.
# Used by 0500 (builds the git shim), 0510 (_qcheck and _qlw) and 0570
# (_QGSHIM and _qknone). Moved from
# parts/0500-continued.sh: _qcheck from line 9, _qlw from line 54, the git shim
# from lines 405-429 and _qknone from line 436.
# Definitions only. _qualify_gshim_build sets _QGSHIM, _qgit and _qknone first
# and does nothing more once the shim is there, so in the serial run only the
# first call (0500's) writes it.

# The checker every demo row of these parts uses, and the widget project's
# qualification table.

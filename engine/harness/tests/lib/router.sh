# tests/lib/router.sh: the widget's lessons and the intent router's tables.
# Used by 0200 (builds the lessons), 0230 (builds the router tables, and reads
# the lessons), and 0240, 0250 and 0590 (the router tables). Moved from
# parts/0200-generated-constitution.sh: the lessons.md heredoc (lines 15-27 as
# the parts stood after the tail of the adoption block left them), and from
# parts/0230-the-intent-router.sh the tables lines 4-11 and 51-69.
# Definitions only. Both builders are guarded: a call in the serial run, where
# the fixture is already there, changes nothing.

# _route PROMPT [DIR]: what felix route says for a prompt, in the widget repository (0230:9).
_route() { ( cd "${2:-$REPO}" && "$FELIX" route --for "$1" 2>&1 ); }

# _lessons_build [force]: the widget's lessons.md, with L-1 and L-2. Written when
# the file does not hold L-1 yet, or always with "force" (0200 writes it so).
_lessons_build() {

## Checklist
1. run the gate
2. update the devlog

## Seeded principles
- **L-1 Migrations need a rollback path.** Long evidence about a migration that
  went wrong, with detail nobody needs mounted on every single turn.
- **L-2 Browser tests belong on critical flows.** More evidence, equally long,
  equally irrelevant until someone is actually touching the browser layer.

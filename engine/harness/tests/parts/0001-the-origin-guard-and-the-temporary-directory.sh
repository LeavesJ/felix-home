# The command line, read before anything is made (contract D1, D2, D5). This is
# the one place that reads it: the driver's argument loop only passes -j N and
# --part over, after the refusals here, and the refusals exit 2 with one line on
# stderr before $TMP exists, so a refused run leaves nothing behind. The words
# are the driver's own: --record-assertions, --reuse, and what this reads, -j N
# and --part NAME... A word the driver does not know ends the reading, as it
# ends the driver's loop. What it leaves for the lines after it:
# - _suite_jobs, N: 1 to 64 in plain decimal, from -j N, else from
#   FELIX_TEST_JOBS, else 1. The variable is read once and unset at once, and
#   a bad one is refused whether or not -j was given. Nothing else sets
#   _suite_jobs; every other file reads it as an expansion.
# - _pm1 to _pm6, part mode's names (--part NAME...), empty when it is off, and
#   the FELIX_TEST_PART_ variables, read here and unset: _pm_log, _pm_ranf,
#   _pm_endf and _pm_rec. Part mode is keyed on the argument alone.
# - with N above 1, _sj_ord (the parts the driver sources, in its order, as
#   " NAME NAME "), and _sj_units: the units of D2, one a line in the driver's
#   order, UNIT, a tab, then its part file names with a blank between. A unit
#   is a group of tests/groups.tsv (D5) or a part in none, 0010 and later,
#   9990 left to the parent. groups.tsv is read only here and only for N above
#   1; a missing, unreadable or broken one is a refusal naming the rule.
# - FELIX_TEST_RED_JOBS, N, exported for a record run under -j N until part 0004
#   unsets it: the one variable red reads (tests/red).

# The remotes of the checkout this run started in, as they stood when it began.
# On 2026-10-08 at 12:47:41 a section runner took this preamble and one cut
# block, the block's fixture roots came out empty, and `( cd "" && git remote
# ... )` edited the config of the worktree the runner stood in, which every
# worktree shares: origin read acme/widget, packed-refs was rewritten, every
# refs/remotes/origin/* was gone and every branch's upstream with them. Nothing
# in the run said so; a person noticed that fetch had failed everywhere.
#
# So a run records what the config files it can reach say about their remotes
# before it does anything, and compares at the end. W, the files watched, holds
# the config in the common git directory of the checkout that encloses the
# directory the run was started in, and of the one that encloses this suite's
# own tree. They are often one file. "Encloses" is found by walking the
# physical path up for a .git entry, a directory or a file as a worktree has
# it, in the shell and with no fork; the common directory is then asked of
# git. Where the walk finds no .git, git is asked once whether the directory
# is in a repository anyway, a bare one, and its config is watched if so. When
# the common config sets extensions.worktreeConfig, the config.worktree of the
# start checkout's own git dir is watched as well, if there is one.
#
# For each file the snapshot keeps, includes followed and in file order, the
# entries that say where a remote is and what it moves: remote.<name>.url,
# pushurl, fetch, push and mirror, url.<base>.insteadOf and pushInsteadOf,
# include.path and includeIf.<condition>.path, and extensions.worktreeConfig.
# For each remote name it keeps whether a ref exists under
# refs/remotes/<name>/, and whether some branch.<b>.remote names it. A remote
# that gains refs or trackers has not moved, since a concurrent fetch or a new
# branch does that; one that had refs and has none, one a branch tracked and
# none does, or a changed entry, has. Not watched, on purpose: the other
# branch.* keys, which sessions change all day; keys outside the list, such as
# the remote.<name>.gh-resolved the gh CLI writes; and the values of remote
# refs, which concurrent fetches move.
#
# It only reads, because it runs before $TMP exists and again in the floor's
# child probes, and it prints nothing and never exits. The one thing it does
# to the shell is a cd -P to learn a physical path, undone at once, OLDPWD
# included. And it fails closed: when a .git was found and the common
# directory, the config or the refs could not be read, the snapshot is marked
# unreadable and the end of the run says so. An empty snapshot would read as

# No fixture git command reaches a repository outside $TMP. On 2026-10-08 one
# did. A section runner took this preamble and the setup block, but not the
# helpers that make the block's fixture directories, so its roots came out
# empty, and in bash 3.2 `( cd "" && git remote set-url origin ... )` exits 0
# where it stands. The runner stood in a developer's worktree, and every
# worktree shares one .git/config. So felix-home's origin came to read
# https://github.com/acme/widget.git, with no refs/remotes/origin left and no
# branch's upstream. That block's own lines, run with both roots empty from a
# worktree of a scratch clone, do exactly that. A fork that fails inside
# `$(_fh_root ...)` under load is a second way to an empty root. A fixture
# directory whose `git init` never ran does the same damage with no empty
# variable, since git walks up to whatever repository encloses it. So does a
# GIT_DIR the caller left in the environment.
#
# A guard on each line would leave the next line written unguarded, so this
# closes the class for every fixture that names its repository by the
# directory it stands in:
# - the suite stands in $TMP/cwd, so an empty root resolves inside $TMP. A
#   root with something after it is not covered: `cd "$empty/x"` lands at /x,
#   or fails;
# - GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES is $TMP's PARENT, so no git command run at or
#   below $TMP walks up out of it. A ceiling is a directory git will not climb
#   INTO. With $TMP as the ceiling, a cwd of $TMP itself, which
#   `cd "$TMP/$empty"` reaches, still climbs into its parent (measured, git
#   2.54). And a ceiling alone, with the suite left in the worktree, stops
#   nothing, since the worktree is not below it;
# - the variables that point git at a repository whatever the cwd are unset.
#   So is GIT_CONFIG, which `git config` writes to even with no repository at
#   all (git 2.54), and OLDPWD, which `cd -` would follow back to the worktree.
# Then the floor is tried: from where the suite now stands, git must say, in
# its own words, that this is not a git repository. Its status alone will not
# do. Git exits 128 too for a repository it finds and refuses to open (dubious
# ownership, a broken .git file), and a git that could not run at all says
# nothing about where the suite stands. Any other answer, and the suite
# refuses to start. A fork that fails inside that capture leaves it empty, and
# empty is a refusal.
#
# The parent is read from $PWD once the shell stands in DIR/cwd, not from
# `$(dirname ...)`, so no fork can fail into an empty ceiling under load. And
# bash has already folded a trailing or doubled slash, which would otherwise
# leave DIR as its own parent. A simple command whose fork fails here kills
# the shell with status 128 (bash 3.2.57), so the suite stops rather than
# starts.

# `claude` CLI: hiding claude locally converts four passes into four skips and
# leaves the attempted total unchanged, while CI attempts two fewer.
#
# A total alone cannot say which two. This records names so the suite can
# compare what it ran against what it is supposed to run, and name the
# difference. A count that silently drops is indistinguishable from a passing
# run, which is the property this repository most needs not to have.
#
# Appended to a file rather than accumulated in a variable, because a shell
# variable does not survive the subshells some of these assertions run inside —
# the same reason PASS and FAIL are incremented in the main shell only.

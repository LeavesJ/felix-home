# ----------------------------------------------------------- fixture floor ----
# Every fixture line in this file that edits a repository does it from a
# directory a variable names: `( cd "$_fs_wr" && git remote set-url origin ... )`.
# On 2026-10-08 one of those variables was empty. Bash 3.2 takes `cd ""` as a
# success and stays where it is, and where it was is wherever the suite was
# started: a developer's worktree. git then edited that repository's config,
# which every worktree of it shares, and the real origin came back as
# acme/widget. Two other shapes do the same with no empty variable at all: a
# fixture directory that exists but where `git init` never ran, from which git
# walks up to the first repository that encloses it, and a GIT_DIR inherited
# from the caller, which names a repository whatever the working directory is.
#
# The preamble closes all three before any fixture is built. _fixture_floor
# moves the suite into $TMP/cwd, unsets the GIT_DIR family, and exports the
# parent of $TMP as GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, so git stops looking before it
# leaves $TMP from any directory inside it. The parent, not $TMP itself,
# measured on git 2.54: a ceiling stops git entering that directory from below
# it, so a working directory EQUAL to the ceiling is not covered, and git walks
# straight up past it.
#
# This section runs first so that a floor which did not hold is the first
# thing a run says. Whatever it does to a repository it does to stand-ins
# under $TMP, and the probes that could reach past $TMP are rev-parse, which
# only reads. Every mutating probe below first asks git which repository it
# would touch, from the same directory and with the same environment, and
# runs only when the answer is none or one under $TMP: a broken floor has to
# fail these assertions, not repeat the incident they describe.
#
# Paths are compared physically. On macOS mktemp says /var/folders/..., the
# filesystem and git say /private/var/folders/..., and both are right.

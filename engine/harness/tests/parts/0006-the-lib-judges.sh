# The judges of tests/lib (contract C2, amended 2026-10-16, third round):
# _lib_runs_nothing FILE, which says whether sourcing a lib file does anything
# but define functions, and _lib_clashes, which says whether a function a lib
# file defines takes a name the suite or the shell already has. Both are defined
# here and not in part 0003, beside _suite_files, because 0003 would pass the
# 1,000 lines part 1040 allows; they are defined before the driver writes
# lib-before.names, so a lib file that defines either is a clash.
#
# The rule: sourced, a tests/lib file defines functions and nothing else. It
# runs no command and sets no variable, not even a plain assignment, because
# the list of variables that change how bash or the suite behaves (FAIL, IFS,
# GLOBIGNORE, POSIXLY_CORRECT, FELIX_TEST_NO_MANIFEST, ...) is open. A builder,
# or a _<name>_vars function, sets variables when a part calls it. A function's
# body runs when a part calls it and is part code like any other.
#
# Both judges read a lib file by sourcing it in a child, and never carry out
# what it holds. The child is a new /bin/bash --noprofile --norc under env -i
# with PATH and HOME, TMPDIR, TMP, FROOT, MEM, REPO, FELIX_HOME and FELIX
# pointing into a fresh scratch directory under $TMP, under set -u and -o
# pipefail, with extdebug on and a DEBUG trap that records each command the file
# would run and returns non-zero, so that command is skipped.
#
# Measured on /bin/bash 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64), in a sourced file:
# - A non-zero status from the DEBUG trap skips the command it fired for, with
#   extdebug on (and set -T, functrace, for the trap to fire inside a sourced
#   file at all). An echo prints nothing, an assignment sets nothing, ": > f"
#   and a bare "> f" create no file, "sleep 20 &" starts no sleep, "$(date)"
#   runs no date: the command substitution inherits the trap and skips its own
#   commands. The skipped command leaves status 0, so a loop whose test is
#   skipped never ends: "while _x=1; do _y=1; done" fires _x=1 and _y=1 forever.
# - A function definition fires nothing, in all three spellings (name() {,
#   name () {, function name {), and not when it sits inside { } or an if. It
#   defines the function, and its body fires only when it is called.
# - Compound commands: if, while, until and { } do not fire for themselves,
#   only for the commands inside, and { } holds a definition without firing at
#   all. for, case, select, (( )) and [[ ]] fire for their header ("for i in
#   1 2" once for each pass, "case a in "), and a skipped for or case skips its
#   body. ( ) and a pipeline run their commands in subshells that have the
#   trap, so those fire there. "time W=1" fires W=1 and prints its timing, to
#   stderr. A skipped test returns status 0, so "if false; then A=1; fi" fires
#   false and then A=1, and "a || b" fires a and not b.
# - What runs before the trap can fire is a redirect on a compound command: "{
#   :; } > f" creates f, and "{ :; } > ${V:=x}" sets V, before the ":" fires.
#   The command is recorded, so the file fails; but the file f is made. That
#   reaches outside the scratch directory if the path says so. A redirect on a
#   simple command is skipped with it.
# - A status of 2 from the trap, in a sourced file, makes the shell return from
#   the file, as extdebug documents. The trap gets it from [[ x =~ ( ]], a
#   regular expression that does not compile (status 2, no message), because
#   "return 2" would be looked up as a function first: a lib file can define
#   return, builtin, printf, declare, or any name, and the trap and everything
#   the child does after the source use only keywords, assignments and
#   absolute paths. The trap returns after 100 recorded commands, so an endless
#   loop in a lib file ends at once instead of at the time limit.
# - set -a makes a function defined in the file an exported one, and /usr/bin/env
#   -0 prints it as a record "BASH_FUNC_name%%=() {...}" (NUL between records,
#   so a here-document in a body that holds a line like that is not a second
#   record). That is how the names come out of the child, with no command of the
#   child's own that a function of the same name could take over. Any variable
#   the file set would be exported the same way, and appear in the second dump.
#
# What the judge does with it, the five conditions of _lib_runs_nothing:
#   1. no command was recorded;
#   2. nothing was printed to stdout or stderr;
#   3. nothing under the scratch directory changed (find -newer a file made
#      just before the run, and the directories still there);
#   4. the child's set of variable names is the same after sourcing as before
#      (the dumps of /usr/bin/env -0, one before the trap is set and one after
#      the file is sourced);
#   5. the child ended normally, within 10 s of wall time (a watcher kills it
#      and leaves a mark; an end mark is made by the child's last command).
# A file with a top-level { } that holds only definitions passes: the group
# runs no command and sets no variable.
#
# The child leaves one file for each command it records, in a directory beside
# the scratch one, named "NNNN text": a bare redirect is the only way to write
# from a trap that no function of the file can replace, and a subshell's
# record, which a variable would lose, survives in the directory.

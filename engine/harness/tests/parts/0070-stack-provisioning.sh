# Put back what this section borrowed. Declaring the state you depend on is half
# the rule; restoring the state you changed is the other half. Seeding a route
# table here made a later assertion about the prompt hook being silent fail,
# because that assertion had been passing on the absence of routes rather than
# on the absence of lessons — which is what it says it tests.
# The branch first, and forced. Routing scores the branch name, and a fixture
# left on `feature/thing` sent four later prompts to the `build` route, whose
# keywords include `feature`. Leaving state behind is not only about files.
#
# Forced, and before the files are removed: deleting a tracked path dirties the
# tree, and a plain checkout then fails silently, which is how the first attempt
# at this cleanup left the branch exactly where it found it.
#
# Restored by pointing HEAD back rather than by checking anything out. This
# fixture has no commits yet — a later section makes the first one — so `main`
# is an unborn branch and `git checkout main` has nothing to check out. The
# branch created here was the first that ever had a commit on it, which is why
# every attempt to return to `main` failed quietly.

# Reproduced before it was believed: a commit deleting the red row for
# engine/harness/lib and adding a green one classified its own engine edit
# green. `verifier` catches that particular shape at merge because a row was
# removed, but classification is a separate surface with its own consumers —
# the tier label, the auto-merge streak, the receipt — and it was wrong at all
# of them.
#
# The rule is now that a change to an enforcing table may only ever tighten the
# diff carrying it. Both versions are evaluated and the stricter wins, so a
# widening applies from the next diff on and a tightening applies immediately.
# That is the base-version evaluation the earned-autonomy decision asks for
# (docs/2026-08-14-earned-autonomy-decision.md §4a), achieved for the tables,
# which is the half of the authority kernel that is data rather than code.

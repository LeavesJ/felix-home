# The streak above and the repair ceiling both read `gh run list --branch <b>`,
# and with nothing else on that line it lists every workflow's runs on the
# branch. That was harmless while a governed repository ran one workflow.
# Elenchus runs three: the gate, the unattended repair that follows it, and
# GitHub's Dependency Graph. Measured on 2026-09-22 over its last 82 runs, all
# 39 that were not the gate's sat on main, 37 of them the repair's, because a
# workflow_run event records the run on the default branch. So on main the
# newest run was usually the repair's own: skipped, which stops the count of
# the gate's failures at zero, or, while it runs, in progress, which would tell
# the repair asking that the gate is still running. On a pull request's branch
# it is latent: a second workflow run there would dirty a green pull request.
# Recorded as item 2 of "before any scheduler" in the direction decisions of
# 2026-09-19.
#
# gh is stubbed, and the stub does what the server does with what it is given:
# it filters by --workflow and --branch, honours --limit, answers a workflow the
# repository does not have with gh's own 404, and lists every workflow when
# --workflow is empty, because gh does. Its output goes through jq for the -q
# expression, since the expressions are the other half of the contract and a
# stub that pattern-matched them would be testing itself.

# Both checkouts left a credential on the runner for the model step to read.
# actions/checkout persists what it fetched with unless told otherwise: the
# job's token as an http.extraheader in repo/.git/config, and the deploy key as
# a file under $RUNNER_TEMP that felix/.git/config's core.sshCommand names by
# path. The model step runs `claude -p` with Read and Edit allowed, and a
# tool-name allow rule matches every path. Measured on the pinned 2.1.37
# (2026-09-23, the real binary against a scripted Messages API): Read returned
# all three files, Edit put their contents in a tracked file, and
# bin/secret-scan passed the diff, since a base64 header and a ghs_ token are
# shapes it does not know; the push step then commits every tracked change.
# Without Read in --allowedTools the two paths outside the working directory
# were refused, so the allow rule is what opens them, and the model needs it.
# The fix is upstream of the model: neither checkout persists, so the key file
# is gone before the scope step runs, and the push step hands git the token
# itself, from its own environment, through a credential helper, so it is in
# no file and no argument.

printf '\nunattended readiness\n'
# #87. Two of the five readiness rows were printf constants. This is the report
# a person reads when deciding whether to switch on a loop that invokes a model
# unattended, and `felix unattended` says outright that Felix will not flip that
# switch for them - so the rows have to be true.
#
# `scope bound` was fully literal, mark and text both, so it stayed checked for a
# project that declares no red path at all - i.e. exactly when nothing is out of
# scope and the bound it names does not exist.
#
# `budget ceiling` is a subtler case and the fix is different. Its [x] was not
# wrong about what it said - a ceiling IS configured, and felix_budget_limit can
# never return "none" - but readiness means the bound HOLDS, and in CI it does
# not: the ledger lives in a checkout made fresh every run (#84). Felix cannot
# determine that mechanically, so the honest mark is neither [x] nor [ ].

# A sha fixes the code an action runs, and its action.yml fixes what runs it:
# setup-node v4.4.0, setup-python v5.6.0 and setup-go v5.6.0 were pinned in
# full and ran on Node 20 while the comment above the checkouts said the file
# had moved to Node 24. The runtime is not in the sha and cannot be read
# offline, so each commit a workflow Felix writes may name is listed here with
# the release that named it and the `using:` its action.yml held, read with gh
# api repos/OWNER/NAME/contents/action.yml?ref=SHA on 2026-10-08. A pin moved
# to a commit missing from the list fails until that read is recorded; a
# recorded runtime other than node24 or composite fails; a comment naming
# another release than the list fails. Every stack the gate workflow renders
# for is read, as above, and the unattended template beside them. A uses: key
# in a shape the reader does not parse, `uses :` or a flow mapping, fails
# rather than being skipped, and so does a render or reader that exits non-zero:
# a reader that never ran prints nothing, which is what a clean file prints.

# ------------------------------------ the project gate's own failure (G5.2) ----
# cmd_gate ran the project gate into a log and then tee'd the engine's own
# check lines into the same log. The recorder took FAIL names from the whole
# of it and fell back to exit-<status> only when the whole log named nothing,
# so a project gate that failed silently beside a failing probe was recorded
# as `probes` alone, which gate_shown_failing excludes: held forever. And a
# project line with no final newline had the first engine line glued onto it.

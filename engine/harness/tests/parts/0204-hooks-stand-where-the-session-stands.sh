# >>> hook-payload-cwd
printf '\nhooks stand where the session stands\n'
# Claude Desktop starts every session with --project-config-root naming the
# main checkout, and Claude Code then spawns every command hook with its cwd
# there, whatever directory the session works in. The session's own directory,
# a worktree as often as not, reaches a hook only as the payload's top-level
# "cwd" (measured 2026-10-02 against the real binary and a mock API). So every
# hook that resolved from $PWD judged the main checkout: a Stop hook told a
# worktree session that the gate had passed "on this exact tree" about the
# main checkout's receipt, ninety seconds after the worktree's own green one.
#
# Written from the contract alone, before any implementation existed. The
# shape is Desktop's: the hook runs in a launch directory, either PCA, a
# governed main checkout, or PCU, a checkout nothing governs, and the
# payload's cwd names PCB, a `git worktree add` of PCA on a commit of its own.
# A home and a memory of its own, set on every call, so nothing here is seen
# by a later section.
#
# The controls, where the payload's cwd equals the launch directory, is absent
# or unusable, or names a directory nothing governs, pass on the engine before
# this change by design: they are the behaviour that must not move.

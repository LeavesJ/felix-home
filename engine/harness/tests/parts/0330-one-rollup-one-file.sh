# Issue #32, reproduced twice by a 15-agent concurrency audit and once more by
# an independent refuter running the registered SessionEnd hook verbatim. The
# rollup was an unlocked read-modify-write of one shared file: it read what
# every other session had committed, spent ~0.17s on per-row work, then renamed
# its own snapshot over the top. Anything committed in between was not merely
# missed, it was deleted, and the file could shrink. Twelve worktrees ending at
# once left 1 of 12; the same twelve run one at a time left 12 of 12.
#
# The input was already per-session, so the fix is to stop sharing the output
# rather than to make sharing safe. A lock was the other candidate and is worse
# for this data: it keeps one writer for rows that have exactly one owner, and a
# lock that is dropped rather than retried loses the same measurement.

# (f) The incident of 2026-09-19, kept as a fixture, because it cannot be
# staged where it happened: the stray sat in the REAL harness, and a suite
# that writes into the tree it is testing is a worse defect than the one this
# pins. So a checkout is built here that holds what that one held — a
# committed engine, and beside it a directory its .gitignore names, dropped
# after the commit the way the hook dropped it — and two cache entries are
# cut from it: one through _copy_content, one with the `cp -R` every fixture
# used until that day. The second is the control. It must be refused, and
# refused naming the stray, or the first being accepted shows nothing: this
# pair is red on every machine without the copy rule, where the incident
# itself needed one developer's global excludes file to show at all.

# and nowhere else, and the copy must still finish and say it succeeded. And

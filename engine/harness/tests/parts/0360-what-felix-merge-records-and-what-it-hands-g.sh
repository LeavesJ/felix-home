printf '\nwhat felix merge records, and what it hands gh\n'
# The contract of the landing change (L1), three rules, tested from outside:
#   1. `felix merge --dry-run` writes nothing to the project's memory, whatever
#      its outcome: a refused escape, an error, or a tree it would squash.
#   2. every refusal of a real run is recorded as `refused` rows in says.log,
#      one per distinct blocker kind printed, or one for a refusal that stops
#      with an error; each row begins `<branch>: ` (`<branch>: <kind>: ` for a
#      blocker) and carries the session; a merge that goes through writes none;
#      `escalated` rows are a real run's alone.
#   3. the `gh pr merge` call carries --match-head-commit HEAD, a non-empty
#      --subject and --body, Felix-Gate and Felix-Judge trailers in the body's
#      last paragraph, and no CI skip marker, for a product and for the
#      repository that ships the engine.
# Written BLIND: the author read neither felix nor lib/escape.sh, only the
# contract and this suite's fixtures. Every repository, the gh stub and the
# kernel cache are its own, under $TMP, at physical paths.
#
# The gh stub records each call as one file, every argument NUL-terminated, so
# argument boundaries survive and a multi-line --body is read back whole. It
# answers every invocation with exit 0 and no output, so it steers nothing.

# `felix brief` on one. It reported a single file and tier yellow. The body also

# an omission — it read as a confident risk verdict, one tier low.

printf '\na receipt that cannot claim more than it knows\n'
# v3.0's domain-OS contract asks each harness for a machine-readable record of
# what changed, why, evidence, risk and result. Felix computes every one of
# those and emits none of them: classify has the risk, evidence has what is
# owed, the gate has the result, escape has the authority question. This is a
# serialiser over facts that already exist.
#
# Two properties come from the transport research rather than from the contract.
# Neither MCP 2026-07-28 nor A2A 1.0.1 carries a bounded authority claim, and
# neither signs task output — so if a receipt is to say on whose authority the
# work proceeded, the receipt itself must carry it, because no transport will.
# And neither models verification as distinct from completion, which is exactly
# what Felix has that they do not, so the gate verdict is its own field.
#
# The load-bearing property is none of that. It is that the receipt CANNOT CLAIM
# VERIFIED ON AN ABSENCE. Six defects in one day were one species — emptiness
# read as success — so the first consumer of this receipt is that rule.

# ------------------------------------- obligations name what discharges them ---
# Roadmap Phase 1, first item. An optional eighth column, `needs`, names the
# checker ids in qualification.tsv that would discharge a row, and each
# resolves as complete (a row for every control), short (declared, some
# missing, named) or absent (no checker by that id). Report only. So the
# controls here hold on the engine before the column existed as much as after
# it: a seven-column row is still a row, and discharge and blocking do not
# move whatever a need resolves to. Fresh fixture dirs, as for the asks above.

# be a grep for `"Event": [`, and the blind control that qualified the first
# obligation moved the whole SubagentStop entry one level down into another
# event's matcher group — every token intact, nothing firing — and the grep
# counted it. The obligation's checker was rewritten to read keys; the probe
# kept the grep and shared the shadow. Now both go through bin/hooks-events,

# Two gates at once, each reporting its own suite. The gate wrote the suite's
# output to one fixed path shared by every gate on the machine, then printed
# that file's last line as the count and its FAIL lines as the evidence. Two
# sessions gating at once each opened it with O_TRUNC and wrote at their own
# offsets, and on 2026-09-21 a gate printed "2645 passed" for a suite that had
# passed 2586. The verdict was never wrong, being the suite's exit status, so
# nothing failed; what a PR body quotes under it belonged to another tree.
#
# The real gate over stub suites. Each stub writes everything, then waits until
# the other has written too before it exits, so both gates read after both
# writes: the collision a shared path allows, made certain rather than likely.
# The lines are of equal length, so a shared file holds one run's output whole
# and cannot pass by holding both. TMPDIR is shared between the two, as it is
# between two sessions on one machine, so only the gate's own choice of path
# keeps them apart. The rendezvous is asserted, because two gates that never
# overlapped would pass this whatever path they used.
#
# Every literal /tmp/ in the copies is moved under the fixture first. A fixed
# path stays one path both copies share, so a gate that uses one still fails
# here for the reason it fails on a machine; but the real one is in use by
# whatever other sessions are gating right now, and tests/red runs this against
# the base's gate, which still writes it. A suite that truncated another
# session's log to prove the log gets truncated would be the defect it names.

# ------------------------- installed asks what main accepted (#2, promotion spec) ---
# docs/2026-08-18-promotion-spec.md, steps 2-4. `installed` asked whether the
# engine in the tree standing here is the one deployed, which only the checkout
# the marketplace serves can ever answer yes to — so `felix merge` existed in one
# folder, and the only workflow that reached it deployed the candidate before it
# was judged. It now asks whether the deployed cache entry for the version MAIN
# declares is byte-identical to MAIN's engine: both sides from the base (§4),
# which is the engine `felix merge` judges with, so the gate certifies the judge.
#
# §8's criteria, criterion 3 first because it is the one the replaced design
# fails. Every fixture pins `git init -b main` (5) and none sets
# FELIX_KERNEL_CACHE (6). The fixture's gate is cut at the `tests` marker so
# each run is syntax, executable and installed and nothing else.

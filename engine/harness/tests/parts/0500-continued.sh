# A run that dies part way. It counted what it had: a run killed after one of
# two met controls said 1 of 1, and one killed before its first said 0 of 0,
# and both exited 0. git is wrapped so that the Kth worktree add kills a
# process of the felix CLI above it and then fails. The processes from that git
# up to the CLI itself all run the CLI's command line, a subshell for each
# $(...), so they are walked up while they do; the one QKILL_BELOW (1 unless
# said) below the CLI is killed. Under felix qualify that is the row loop; under
# felix gate the one below the CLI is felix qualify --gate itself, and the one
# below that its row loop. It never kills the CLI, nor the suite, and leaves a
# mark when it has killed, so a run it never reached is a failure and not a
# pass. Both controls are met, so the death is the only reason to refuse.

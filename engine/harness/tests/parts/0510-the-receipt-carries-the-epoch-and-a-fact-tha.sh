# Every value a verdict is computed from takes its status from its own
# assignment. One read is not enough if the held count, the total, the rows
# run, the checkers, a checker's controls or the checkers never shown failing
# come out of a pipeline whose status nobody reads. So awk, tr, cut and sort
# are each wrapped to fail their Nth call with exit 2 without running, for
# every N a clean run makes, over three tables.
#
# One has a met violation and a held restoration and nothing else wrong, so
# every right answer refuses. The held control expects pass: a command field
# that came back empty, as a field cut by a fork that failed once did, ran
# `eval ""`, passed, and met it.
#
# One has a met restoration and demo's only fail control, whose premise is
# absent here, so demo is never shown failing and every right answer refuses.
# The list of checkers never shown failing, failing, came back empty, and read
# as every checker shown.
#
# One has a single met control. It may exit 0 only with the output a clean run
# gives, word for word, and that output shows the control met and demo's
# shortfall naming the five controls it lacks: a list of its controls that
# failed to empty named all six missing, violation too, and a list of the
# checkers, or of what one lacks, that failed to empty said no shortfall at
# all, and each passed. Exiting non-zero once its report has begun, it says
# what could not be read or worked out; a fault before that, in finding which
# project governs the checkout, stops felix with a refusal of its own.
#
# Two checks no fault here can reach are kept as defence in depth, not pinned
# by a test invented for them. The split of felix qualify's one read into rows
# and malformed rows refuses a line tagged neither way, but that read is one awk
# that tags every line it prints or fails whole. And --gate wanting at least
# one verdict repeats what the refusals of no selected row and of fewer
# verdicts than rows already make true.

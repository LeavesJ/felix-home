printf '\nqualification: a row runs in a shell of its own\n'
# A row's premise, mutation and command ran inside the process that called the
# runner, so they took that process's options, and the felix CLI's are
# set -uo pipefail. Under pipefail `producer | grep -q x` fails when x is
# there: grep leaves at its first match and the producer dies of SIGPIPE. Under
# nounset a name the row never set stops the row. Each column moves a verdict
# its own way. A premise that misfires skips its control, or applies it where
# the premise is absent. A mutation cut short leaves a pass control met over a
# change the checker never saw. A command that misfires reads fail, and on a
# fail control fail is met, which is exactly what a working checker says, so
# nothing later can tell the two apart. Probes, obligations and maintenance
# run their rows in a fresh bash with nothing on stdin, and a row here runs the
# same way. There a command or mutation that exits 126 or 127 ran nothing, so
# it is unrunnable, never a verdict.
#
# Every call is made from a shell that sets -uo pipefail itself, whatever the
# suite's own options are. The producer writes about 2.7 MB with the match on
# its first line. That is far more than a pipe holds, so the producer is
# certainly still writing when grep leaves, and the miss does not depend on
# load. Authored blind to the runner's source, from the contract in prose.

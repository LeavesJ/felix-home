printf '\nqualification: a row'"'"'s scratch tree never outlives the row\n'
# A row checks its control in a scratch worktree of the root's HEAD, made under
# a base directory of its own, and throws both away when it is done. Two things
# left them behind. A mutation that takes permission away inside its base,
# `chmod a-w d` over a file, left git unable to delete the file: the tree stayed
# on disk, and on some git versions in the root's worktree list as well. And
# nothing handled INT, TERM or HUP: a row signalled while a column ran died on
# the spot, its tree on disk and still registered in the root. Three such trees
# were found in the founder's own checkout. A row stopped by a signal, with its
# caller still running the rows, reached no verdict, so it reads unrunnable,
# never held and never met.
#
# A review then found what else a mutation can do to its own base. It can
# delete the tree's .git file, lock the worktree, delete the whole base, swap
# the tree for a symlink to another worktree, which git then removes in its
# place, uncommitted work and all, or hard-link files from outside into it,
# whose mode a careless chmod -R then changes outside. It can make the file a
# column's stderr goes to unwritable, which turned a checker that never ran
# into a fail, or a symlink to a file outside, which a later column then
# truncated, or whose contents faked a verdict. None of it may leave anything,
# change anything outside, or change a verdict. A felix: line on stderr speaks
# only of a tree or registration that is really left.
#
# Every path mktemp hands the runner is logged, by a function that wraps it in
# the shell that calls the runner. A leftover is any of those paths still there,
# or any worktree the root lists beside itself, live, prunable or locked; this
# root is the section's own and starts with none. A signalled run starts in a
# process group of its own, made by perl with INT, TERM and HUP back at their
# defaults: a background job starts with INT ignored, and a signal ignored at
# entry cannot be trapped. The held column marks itself running and waits on a
# release file made as soon as the signal has gone, with a bound of its own, so
# an unsignalled column runs on to its end and is never asserted cut short.
# Every wait has a deadline. Only processes of that group, walked down from the
# pid started here, are ever signalled. Whatever an old runner leaves behind,
# the section gives directories their permissions back (never a file, which may
# be a hard link to one outside), clears an immutable flag, removes it, and
# unlocks and prunes its own roots alone. Authored blind to the fix, from the
# contract in prose.

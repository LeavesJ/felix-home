printf '\nqualification: a control whose premise is absent\n'
# A control that plants a governed project's name cannot be met in a checkout
# that governs only itself: there is nothing there for the mutation to break.
# Counting it held turns a correct engine red, and counting it met would be a
# lie about a check that never ran. So a row may carry a premise, evaluated in
# the worktree of HEAD before the mutation, and a premise that does not hold
# makes the control inapplicable.
#
# The trap in a third verdict is that it stops a control failing without fixing
# anything: a premise that always fails silences its control forever. That is
# why a premise that errors is unrunnable rather than inapplicable, and why a
# checker whose every fail control was inapplicable is named as never shown
# failing and refuses the gate. Writing a fail control is the claim that the
# checker catches something, and anything that claims to verify is shown
# failing before it is believed; a gate reading ok over a checker nobody has
# seen fail breaks that. The remedy is a control that stages its own premise.
#
# Authored by a subagent given this behaviour in prose and forbidden the

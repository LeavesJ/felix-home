# 2026-10-08: a third review of the revoke fix found it taking a read it could
# not finish for a file with nothing to remove. The line loop was fed from a
# here-string, which bash 3.2 writes to a temporary file in /tmp or /var/tmp,
# not $TMPDIR. Where that write failed, under a sandbox or a file-size limit,
# the loop never ran: over a line only an older reader grants, the CLI said
# "revoked: tidy" and kept the line, and over a plain grant it refused with the
# false word that another writer had rewritten the file. The review found the
# revoke's trim narrower than the encodings a locale runs in: the ideographic
# space is \201@ in Shift-JIS and \241@ in Big5, and GB18030's four-byte spaces
# hold digits, so trimming every byte from 0x80 up missed them all. A revoke
# now removes a line that holds the capability once and no other ASCII letter
# or '#', since no whitespace in any of those encodings holds either. And it
# found the revoke quadratic in the size of the file. These pin a read that
# cannot finish to a refusal that says so, the names rule across encodings with
# this engine's reader left strict, a revoke linear in CPU, and the gaps the
# review's mutants slipped through: the mode kept through a link, an unended
# grant, an unreadable file's refusal and a rename that is refused.

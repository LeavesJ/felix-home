# And the load-bearing claim, made falsifiable: a granted run DECLARES and

#
# The claim is that the grant governs when a declaration happens, never what
# gets installed. That is not a promise about intent — it is a property of the
# path: felix_commission_apply_declares appends a stack.tsv row and a log line,
# and no installer is downstream of it. Installing those rows is still
# felix stack apply, which a person still runs.
#
# Asserted against the stub CLI's log, because "installs nothing" is a
# statement about what reached `claude`, not about what the source intends.
# Asserted at the function that applies a verdict, because that is where an
# install would have to happen if one happened at all. A first draft asserted
# it over a whole `felix commission` run and found an empty stub log — which
# passed, and meant only that the run never reached the CLI. The positive
# control below is what caught that: the row must appear, or "nothing was
# installed" is a statement about a path nothing walked.

# grepped ONE hard-coded literal, `elenchus`, over three paths. Constitution
# invariant 1 is "The engine names no project" - the first invariant in the
# file - and what the check established was that seven particular letters were
# absent from three of the directories under engine/harness.
#
# Demonstrated against the real gate before this was written: an engine that
# hard-codes `veldra`, a project Felix actually governs, passes; the identical
# edit naming `elenchus` fails.
#
# The names are enumerated from projects/ so governing something new cannot
# quietly widen what the engine may say. The engine's OWN name is exempt and
# has to be: `felix` appears 1452 times in runtime code because it is the
# product, the function prefix and the binary, not a governed product being
# named. `bin/` is in the searched set because the gate EXECUTES it - the
# literal `elenchus` sitting in engine/harness/bin/secret-scan passed before.
#
# tests/ and templates/ stay out, deliberately. This suite names Elenchus in
# its own comments on purpose, since explaining what it refuses to depend on is
# the point, and the widget fixture names itself 256 times.
#
# A project is a directory that DECLARES itself with a project.json, not one

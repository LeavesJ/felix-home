# Invariant 1, one level up from the name.
#
# The independence block above proves the engine names no governed PROJECT. It
# cannot see the other half of the same invariant. A detector in engine/harness
# hard-coded to FastAPI route decorators and an Anthropic client construction
# site contains no project name, passes that check, and encodes exactly one
# project's shape into an engine whose whole claim is that it holds none. That
# is not hypothetical: it is a design that was drafted for Felix and would have
# shipped.
#
# So the words are enumerated the way the names are - off reality, never off a
# literal. Reality here is lib/detect.sh: the alternation tokens inside its own
# _felix_dep_grep calls ARE the set of ecosystems the engine reasons about, so
# teaching the probe a new framework arms this check for it in the same commit.
#
# What reality cannot supply is a stance. Some ecosystems the engine reaches
# through a manifest FILENAME rather than a probe token - `pyproject.toml` never
# spells `python` - and some probe tokens are ordinary English (`next`) and can
# never be enforced. Those are `word` and `mute` rows, each carrying a written
# reason, in the style of deny.tsv and risk.tsv. Felix holds stances; it does
# not author the enumeration.
#
# Matching is word-boundaried, and that is a measured choice rather than a
# neat one. Substring matching flags `cohere` inside "coherent", `vite` inside
# "invite" and `express` inside "expressed" - three false positives in the
# engine's own prose today. Word boundaries leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` alone,
# which is correct twice over: bin/secret-scan and lib/unattended.sh both name
# it as a credential, which is what they are for.

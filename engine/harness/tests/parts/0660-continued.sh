# A `when` that answers neither yes nor no is unknown, as in a probe.
#
# felix_commission_state read every status of a `when` other than 0, 126 and
# 127 as the grounded state saying no, and skipped the row's step, so a `when`
# that crashed failed open. Probes and obligations already read anything that
# is neither 0 nor 1 as unknown. The status alone could not carry it either:
# the row runs in-process and inherits the CLI's `set -u`, so a `when` naming
# an unset variable ended the shell running it with 1, which is what a real no
# returns, and felix_commission_ask folded every status but 0, 126 and 127 to 1
# before the state saw it. So the ask keeps the status and, asked, says whether
# the text returned it, ended the shell with it, or was never run because the
# checkout could not be entered; a `when` that does not parse is unknown and
# never run; a `when` that ended the shell with 0 still applies. The check
# column is pinned unchanged, because anything but 0, 126 and 127 there is
# held, and held fails closed. Everything this touches is restored below and
# everything it defines unset.

# Added with the fix, and after review, not blind: parts of it that mutations
# showed nothing above could fail.
#   - What a `when` prints goes nowhere, so the state reads neither it as the
#     answer nor noise in place of one.
#   - The answer is read without waiting for a job the `when` left running.
#     bash marks the copy of stdout it saves around the eval close-on-exec, so
#     a program such as `sleep 30 &` never holds it; a job that is itself a
#     forked shell does, and a reader waiting for end of file waits for it.
#     The job below reaps its own sleep when it is stopped.
#   - A `when` reads nothing from its caller's stdin, which in a run is the
#     table: one that read it would eat the rows after it.
#   - Its stderr goes nowhere, an ask that is given no variable sets none, a
#     garbled answer line is unknown, and a checkout that cannot be entered is
#     unknown even for a row no check follows.

# A lookup that could not be made is unknown, never a no.
#
# felix_commission_state decides a row from lookups made inside $(...), and
# under load a fork inside one fails with EAGAIN: the substitution prints
# nothing and returns 128. Three lookups read that as a valid answer. The
# declared capabilities came back as none, so a row whose capability is
# declared read not-applicable and the receipt said commissioned; the run's
# empty-state guard cannot see it, because not-applicable is a state. The
# engine functions a check names came back as none when the grep that reads
# them ran and failed, so a check over a function that is not loaded ran and
# read done. (Amended after review: a fork that failed there skipped the
# `|| true` and, under the CLI's pipefail, read unknown naming no function;
# done only without pipefail. The stub below models the grep that failed.)
# And the count of an answer's rows came
# back empty, the comparison with its done line errored and was false, and the
# answer read answered, whole or not, which is the state every ingestion
# reads. The adversarial reviewer of the empty-state fix above found the
# first on bash 3.2; the other two were found by surveying the same shape. Here
# nothing is starved of processes: inside _cm the lookup is replaced by one
# that fails as a substitution whose fork could not be made fails, printing
# nothing and returning 128, and the engine is called after it. A list that was
# read and is empty is still a no; one that could not be read is unknown. These

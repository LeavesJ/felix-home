# Every other reader of the declared capabilities says the list could not be read, never that it is empty (1 of 2).
#
# felix_declared returns 2 when something is at `capabilities` and could not be
# read, and a substitution around it can end with nothing printed and status 0
# when its fork could not be made. Only _felix_cap_active and its callers said
# so. Every other reader read either as an empty list and made a claim from it:
# felix recommend printed `declared: none` and `waits for <cap>` for a
# capability that may be declared; felix doctor printed an empty declared line
# and every detected surface as undeclared drift, because felix_undeclared
# subtracted nothing from what felix_detect found; session start adopted
# whatever felix_undeclared printed; felix_probes_gaps dropped every
# declared-only capability from the gaps and felix_probes_orphans called a probe
# grounding one an orphan. Items 1 to 6 of the contract in
# docs/handoff/pending/20261001T235048Z-claude-declared-unread-readers.md, and a
# felix_declared_into that assigns a list only when it was read.
# The library is asked with felix_declared failing three ways, each defined in a
# subshell after the libs are sourced: returning nonzero, printing one declared
# capability and then returning nonzero, and exiting before anything is printed,
# which is what a substitution whose fork could not be made looks like from the
# line that reads it. The capabilities file DOES declare the capabilities in
# question, so a list read as empty shows. The CLI and the hook are other
# processes and cannot see a stub, so there the capabilities file is a link
# whose target is gone; session start is also run from a scratch copy of the
# engine whose detect.sh ends with the failing function. Nothing here needs the
# claude CLI: the project has no routes.tsv, so session start never discovers.
# These assertions were written blind, from the contract, before the fix, and
# each was run against main's engine and the branch base first.
# Everything this makes is removed below and everything it defines unset.

# After review, not blind: the readers of the declared capabilities that the
# review of the first pass found still dropped a list, or said one was unread
# when it was not.
#
# The three reviewers (defeat, simpler, omission) read the first pass of
# declared-unread-readers and each demonstrated what follows. A project with no
# commissioning.tsv returned 1 from felix_commission_topology under pipefail,
# because its status was the cat of that table, so felix obligations --request
# refused over a list that was read and an answered request read unknown.
# felix discover --adopt looked at the list only when the cache was stale, so a
# current cache over an unread list adopted its rows and asked claude to install
# them, and a fill whose own read failed after that said the marketplaces could
# not be read. A here-document that cannot be written, and a felix_detect that
# exits inside the group it was unioned in, dropped a list that had been read.
# felix_commission_policy_version opened a capabilities link whose target is gone
# as no file and a pipe by that name as a file to wait on. A failed
# felix_declared forged the sentinel with a last line ending in a dot.
# felix_capture is the helper the sentinel now lives in. R1 to R6 of "After
# review: what changes" in
# docs/handoff/pending/20261001T235048Z-claude-declared-unread-readers.md.
# These assertions were NOT written blind: they were written after the fix, from
# the reviewers' evidence. Each but six was shown failing against the first pass
# at 1e0197ca, the engine this change is a fix to, before it was shown passing:
# 24 of the 30 were red there, and the six that were not are five controls over a
# list that was read and the check that the block leaves the tree as it found it.
# The libraries are asked in subshells after the libs are sourced, under pipefail
# as the CLI and the hooks are. Here-documents are made unwritable inside the
# subshell with an ignored SIGXFSZ and a file size limit of nothing, which a bash
# that writes a here-document to a temporary file meets, 3.2 among them, and a
# bash that sends a small one through a pipe does not: the assertions pass there
# and fail only where the defect is. The CLI and the hook
# are other processes, so there the capabilities file is a link whose target is
# gone. The block makes one scratch copy of the engine, which adds a
# felix_declared that fails only for _felix_discover_rules and, for the last case,
# lacks the obligations template. The marketplace is a stub on PATH that records
# every call. Nothing reaches the network or installs anything.
# Everything this makes is removed below and everything it defines unset.

# felix commission adopts nothing over a declared list it could not read, and
# says that capability drift was not checked.
#
# Since #378 a full `felix commission` adopts, before it asks any row, every
# capability the checkout shows and the project has not declared, as session
# start does. When the project's declared-capabilities list could not be read,
# a full run adopts nothing, leaves capabilities, stack.tsv and setup.tsv byte
# for byte, prints no `adopted before this run` line, and prints
# `Capability drift was not checked: <why>.` after the `commissioning for
# <project>` line and before the first row line; the rows and the summary are
# still printed. Over a list that was read (one that declares something, none
# at all, or an empty one) a full run adopts and says so, exactly as before,
# and never prints the drift line. `--status` adopts nothing and prints neither
# line, read or unread. Item 14 of the contract in
# docs/handoff/pending/20261001T235048Z-claude-declared-unread-readers.md.
# These assertions were written blind, from that contract item alone, before
# the fix: the body of cmd_commission was not read.
# The CLI is another process, so the unread list is a `capabilities` link whose
# target, in a directory that exists, does not: a write through the link would
# create it. The checkout shows ci (a workflow file) and secrets (.env.example);
# the read fixture declares secrets only, so ci is there to adopt. The
# commissioning table holds two rows with no grounds, one done and one held, so
# an unread list changes neither row and the summary is known in advance.
# HOME is a scratch directory and PATH holds a `claude` that logs and refuses
# everything, so nothing reaches the network, ~/.claude or an installed CLI.
# The exit status is not part of the item and is not asserted.
# Everything this makes is removed below and everything it defines unset.

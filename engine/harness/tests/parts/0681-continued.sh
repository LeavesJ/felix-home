# After the second review, not blind: the places a read list still passed through a
# substitution that can come back empty, a here-document, or a hash read twice.
#
# Two Opus reviewers (defeat, simpler) read the after-review fixes at 4ccc9e09 and
# each demonstrated what follows. These assertions were NOT written blind: they
# were written after the review, from its evidence, and each one that can fail
# was shown failing against 4ccc9e09, the engine this change is a fix to, before
# it was shown passing. Every item is named at the paragraph that opens it.
# A command that is another process (the CLI) is run with a stub first on PATH:
# a grep that execs the real one except when an argument is -c, where it prints
# nothing and exits 2, and a tr that execs the real one except for tr '\n' ' ',
# where it prints nothing and exits 1. That is what a substitution whose fork or
# pipe failed looks like from the line that reads it. Nothing reaches the network,
# ~/.claude or an installed CLI, and nothing here runs a gate.
# Everything this makes is removed below and everything it defines unset.

# A table command whose last stage succeeds whatever it is fed is refused.
#
# Every table runner evaluates a row with pipefail off: probes, obligations,
# setup and maintenance each start a `bash -c`, and commissioning evaluates
# in-process under `set +o pipefail`, as the section above pins. So a
# pipeline's status is its last stage's, and `npm test 2>&1 | tail -20` reads
# done or SATISFIED when the tests fail, because tail exits 0 whatever it
# reads. lib/final-filter.sh names such a stage, and the four columns where an
# unfailable command reads as a pass refuse the row: commissioning's check,
# obligations' evidence, setup's check and maintenance's check. The columns
# where one only asks more are not judged: a commissioning `when`, an
# obligation's `applies`, and a probe's `when`, probe and witness.
#
# Written blind, from the contract and before the library existed. The
# classifier's cases are the contract's own examples plus one case per filter
# and per condition, and every refusal has an admitted partner near it: a
# false refusal fails a project's gate, where a false admission only leaves
# today's hole, so the admitted half is the one that must not regress. Two
# shapes are red against the engine this replaces, one in each direction:
# commissioning refused any check holding `| head -`, so
# `[ "$(x | head -1)" = y ]` was malformed, and nothing refused
# `x | tail -20 || exit 1`.
#
# The table libraries are sourced the way their neighbours source them, and
# never with final-filter.sh alongside: a table library that assumed its
# classifier was already loaded would admit every row wherever it was not,
# which is the open direction. Every table touched is restored below and
# every helper unset.

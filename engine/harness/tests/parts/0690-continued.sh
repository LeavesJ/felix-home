# The rule the blind section above was amended to, and what review found. A
# text is refused only when it cannot fail and a final filter is why, so a
# guard that can fail admits it, and a constant run on a hidden status
# decides nothing. A bare exit returns the status before it; set -e anywhere
# counts from the start; `! !` is a bash 3.2 syntax error; tr and uniq with an
# operand count they refuse fail every time. Written by the implementer, not
# blind, after the rule changed.
#
# The second review's findings follow FFAUTHOR's first block, each admitted
# case measured on macOS 26.3.1 under /bin/bash 3.2, and each with a refused
# partner where one shows the rule still bites: an exit in a for or case
# whose words ran a command returns their status; exec ends the script; kill
# can; quotes and expansions cannot hide pipefail; hash, shopt and PATH can
# change what a name runs; a redirect reading any fd, closing one or
# duplicating fd 3 or above can fail; bash-4 redirects bash 3.2 misreads;
# usage errors on either platform; and nounset, which commissioning runs
# under, ending a text at an unset name.
#
# The verification pass found the same classes under other spellings, and
# commands before the last that end the shell: ${y:?}, arithmetic, [[ ]],
# readonly, a kill from any process. The rows after `HOME is always set` take
# one spelling per class, each admitted one measured failing under /bin/bash
# 3.2 but the two GNU-only refusals, and red against the classifier before
# that fix; the refused rows beside them are what still bites.
# A second verification pass found read-only names, POSIX mode in sh,
# quoted builtin names, nice values, awk arrays and syntax, and killpg; its
# rows follow the fuzzing find, each admitted one red against the classifier
# before that fix.

# A run that reported fewer rows than its table lists, and counts or a receipt
# that are not numbers.
#
# felix_commission_run prints one line per row from a loop in a shell of its
# own, and returns 0 whatever became of that shell. On bash 3.2 a fork that
# fails there, or a pipe it cannot make, ends that shell with status 128: the
# rows after it are never printed, the run still returns 0, and the receipt
# was written over the rows that were. A reviewer measured a table of three
# rows giving one line and a receipt that read commissioned, the held row
# gone. Only the reader of the output can catch that, by asking for every need
# the table lists, once each and in order. Here nothing is starved of
# processes: the check on a row's state, which the loop calls in its own
# shell, is replaced inside _cm by one that ends that shell on the second row,
# as a failed fork does.
#
# The counts are six substitutions read back with one split. When one came
# back empty the split merged the gap and every count after it moved one place
# left; when all of them did, the tests compared empty strings, said so on
# stderr, and fell through to commissioned, and the reader accepted the
# receipt that resulted. Here the counts function is replaced inside _cm by
# one that prints the broken line, a count is made to come back empty by a
# grep that prints nothing for the unknown rows, and a receipt is rewritten in
# place with counts or a result no run writes. For the command, two stubs are
# appended to the fixture's copy of the library for the length of five runs,
# and the copy is put back byte for byte.
# These assertions were written blind, from the contract, before the fix.
# Everything this touches is restored below and everything it defines unset.

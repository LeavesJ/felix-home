# ------------------------------------------------- the admit phase ----------
# A nomination is a name in a file a model wrote. Nothing has been fetched,
# nothing read, and the file carries no tier anywhere — so the only way it
# becomes installable is for the engine to go and look, which is what turns it
# from INFERRED into OBSERVED. That is the whole phase: source, fetch at a
# pinned sha, read three files, tier what was read, and ask the one policy.
#
# The network boundary is the only thing stubbed. Everything below it — the
# inspection, the tiering, the capability match and the admit call — is the
# shipped code running against a plugin tree on disk, because stubbing the
# tiering would assert only that the test agrees with itself.

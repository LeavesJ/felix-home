# ------------------------------------------ executable-check, the bit that ships ---
# Felix runs entirely through scripts something else invokes: the CLI, this
# suite, every scanner under bin/ and every hook under hooks/. A lost executable
# bit does not fail here — it fails in somebody else's session, silently, once
# the plugin is deployed. So the check must (a) enumerate what is actually on
# disk, or a scanner added next week is unprotected the day it lands, (b) judge
# by the shebang rather than the directory, or a README turns the gate red, and
# (c) distinguish "every script is fine" from "I could not look", which is the
# failure this repository keeps rediscovering under a green line.
#
# The fixture is a small invented engine, not a copy of the real one: the count
# it reports is then a number the assertions can name, and a check that silently
# stopped enumerating would have to lie about it rather than merely look busy.

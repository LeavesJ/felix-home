printf '\ndecision epochs: the four things a decision was made under\n'
# v3.2 §3 defines the epoch as hash(subject_identity, topology_version,
# policy_version, release_target), and the whole no-backsliding rule hangs off
# it: inside one epoch admitted blocking obligations may hold or grow and
# discovery may not remove or relax them, and it is a NEW grounded topology or
# a NEW policy state that reopens applicability.
#
# So there are exactly two properties worth asserting, and they are opposites.
# A number that drifted on its own would silently reopen every obligation a
# project had already admitted. A number that sat still while the world moved
# would freeze a project under a topology it no longer has. Everything below is
# one or the other: stable when nothing about the decision context changed,
# different when any of the four inputs did.

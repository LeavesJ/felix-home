printf '\nthe graph nothing ever mentioned\n'
# Across 72 recorded sessions the knowledge graph beside a governed checkout was
# built three times and queried once. Nothing was broken: the graph was simply
# never mentioned, and a fact nobody states is a fact nobody uses. lib/graph.sh
# turns it into a sentence every session starts with — that a graph exists, how
# far it has drifted from the code, and the command that asks it.
#
# Two properties make or break that. It runs in every session of every governed
# project, so it may not read two megabytes of JSON to find one field, and it
# may never claim a currency it cannot establish: a graph whose stamp names a
# commit this repository does not hold is a graph of somebody else's tree, and
# saying "current" there is worse than saying nothing.
#
# The case this library exists to get right is the worktree. A worktree has no
# graph of its own — the graph belongs to the checkout that holds the shared
# .git — so every one of these functions has to look past the tree it was
# handed. Which is why the fixture below builds a real one and lets its HEAD
# diverge, rather than asserting about a directory named "worktree".

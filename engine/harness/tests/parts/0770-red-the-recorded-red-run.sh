# ------------------------------------------------- red, the recorded red run ---
# tests/red runs the calling tree's assertions against the engine a base commit
# holds and writes down which of them fail, so a red assertion is a claim on
# file rather than a surprise on CI. Written blind from the contract, against a
# fixture repository rather than this checkout: its committed engine carries an
# old marker and a run that announces itself if anything executes it; its
# working tree moves the marker on, uncommitted, and brings a run that reads
# its lib relative to its own path the way the real suite does. Against the
# base's lib that run must go red on exactly the lib-derived assertions, and
# against the tree's it would not — which is the whole point of the script.

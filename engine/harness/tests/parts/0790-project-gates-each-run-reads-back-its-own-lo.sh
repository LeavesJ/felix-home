printf '\nproject gates: each run reads back its own logs\n'
# Felix's own gate was one instance (the "two gates at once" block). The same
# shape sat in the scripts Felix holds for the projects it governs: Elenchus's
# gate wrote ruff's check, ruff's rewrite, lint and pytest to four fixed files
# under /tmp and read them back for its file list, its test count and its
# FAILED lines; its push guard took its suite count from a fifth; Veldra's gate
# printed clippy, test, rustfmt and gitleaks excerpts from four more. Every gate
# on the machine shared each file, so a gate could print another tree's
# evidence under a verdict that was its own. Found 2026-09-21, the day the
# felix instance was measured.
#
# The felix block's method, over all three scripts. One stand-in plays python,
# cargo and gitleaks; it names its tree in everything it writes, then waits at
# a barrier until the other tree's run reaches the same step, so both writes
# land before either script reads: the collision a shared path allows, made
# certain. Output is the same length in both trees, so a shared file holds one
# run whole. TMPDIR is shared, as it is between two sessions, and each script's
# literal /tmp/ is moved under the fixture: a fixed path is still one path both
# copies share, and tests/red runs this against the base's scripts, which must
# not truncate a real session's log to prove the point. The barriers are
# asserted, because two runs that never overlapped pass whatever path they use.

# Veldra's fmt check ran `cargo fmt --all`, then reported

# file with uncommitted work, so mid-task the check went red and listed files
# rustfmt never touched. And git diff cannot see an untracked file, so a new
# file rustfmt rewrote passed in silence. Elenchus's gate had the same defect
# and fixed it 2026-08-05; this is the Rust form of that fix: ask
# `cargo fmt --all -- --check` first, rewrite, report only what the check
# named, and fail loudly when the check failed and no name parsed.
#
# The stand-in prints what rustfmt printed when measured on 2026-09-21: one
# `Diff in <canonical path>:<line>:` per hunk. The tree is reached through a
# symlink, as FELIX_GATE_ROOT can be, so the path rustfmt prints is not the
# one the gate was handed. Each script's literal /tmp/ is moved under the

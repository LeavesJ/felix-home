# ------------------------------------------------------ felix inventory ----
# Where unlanded work is, derived rather than registered: a session that dies
# registers nothing, so felix inventory reads disk, git, gh and the host's
# session records, and writes nothing anywhere. Written blind, from the spec
# alone (audits/2026-09-24-lost-work-sweep/inventory-spec.md), while the
# command was being written by someone else, so each assertion names the
# contract and none reads a wording.
#
# Rows are read from --tsv (kind repo ref states owner age_h content detail). A row is
# found by the name the fixture gave its item: a worktree by its directory, a
# branch by its name, a pull request by its number, first in the ref column
# and else anywhere on the line. A state is a token of the states column, in
# the spec's vocabulary; a pull request's words are whole words of its detail.
# Every check needs the row to exist, so an item left out never passes as an
# item without the state. Placed after the audit section, whose transcript
# helpers (_au_open and the rest) it uses.

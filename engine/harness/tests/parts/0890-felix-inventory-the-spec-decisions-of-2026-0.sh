# ---- spec decisions of 2026-09-24 ----------------------------------------
# Six decisions Felix took on the spec after review, each held to the rule it
# sets and each seen failing on the command as it stood before it was built:
#   D1 a session ended on a question when its final assistant text asks,
#      and no human text follows. Asks is the rule measured on 227 real
#      endings read by hand on 2026-09-24: fenced blocks, code spans,
#      double-quoted spans and blockquotes set aside, a ? ends a line in the
#      last three paragraphs, or the text makes one of ten offers (say the
#      word, want me to, your call, ...) not negated within its clause. The
#      note stays the text's last 160 characters, cut on a character boundary
#   D2 live is the newest mtime among a session's own file and every file
#      under its <session-id>/subagents/ (workflows/ too); blocked also needs
#      nothing there written within --blocked; question and blocked read the
#      session's own file only
#   D3 superseded 2026-10-01 (spec §5, §5.1): what was read is five cover
#      rows per repository, ref the facet; no row is of kind repo
#   D4 --days defaults to 14, and the human view states the window
#   D5 a worktree or orphan under $TMPDIR, /tmp, /private/tmp or
#      /private/var/folders carries the detail word temp, keeps its states,
#      and is listed in a group of its own after what needs action
#   D6 no code: pending/ only, which the handoff assertions above hold
# D1, D2 and D4 are built on a fourth repository, doohickey, so nothing above
# changes its fixture; D3 and D5 read the runs above as well.

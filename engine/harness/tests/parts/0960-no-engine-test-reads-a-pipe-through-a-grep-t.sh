printf '\nno engine test reads a pipe through a grep that can stop early\n'
# Under pipefail, `producer | grep -q x` reads "absent" for a value that is
# there whenever grep matches and exits while the producer still has output to
# write: the producer's next write breaks the pipe, it dies of SIGPIPE (141),
# and pipefail hands that status to the `if`, `&&`, `||` or `!` reading it.
# The first pair below pins that on the machine running the suite, because the
# lint after it is only worth having while it holds.
#
# _spl_scan is the lint's one matcher, and the same code reads the samples and
# the engine. It prints file:line wherever a `|` that is not half of `||` is
# followed, after optional `command`, `env`, `nice`, `timeout N`, `if` and `!`
# words, VAR=value prefixes and a leading backslash, by grep, egrep or fgrep
# that can stop reading early. One way is an option that lets it: -q, -m, -l or
# -L, alone or inside a cluster (-qxF, -Eq, -m1), or --quiet, --silent,
# --max-count, --files-with-matches or --files-without-match. Options are read
# letter by letter, and one that takes an argument (-e, -f, -A, -B, -C, -d, -D,
# --regexp, --file, --context and its halves) takes the rest of its word, or
# the next word, with it: `-e pat -q` is flagged, and `-eline` is not read as
# -l. The other is a standard output on /dev/null, whatever the options: GNU
# grep, the grep on Linux, reads that as -q and stops at its first match, even
# given -c. So `>/dev/null`, `> /dev/null`, `1>`, `>>`, `&>`, `>&` or `>|`,
# before or after `2>&1`, anywhere in grep's own command is named. That command
# runs to the first `|`, `;` or `&&` outside quotes, or to a comment, and on
# past a backslash that ends its line; it does not stop at `)` or a lone `&`.
# A digit glued to a word before `>` is
# part of the word, so `y2>/dev/null` is standard output; `2>/dev/null` alone
# is not named, since where grep's errors go changes nothing. A pipe that ends
# one line, or ends its code before a comment, carries onto the next line of
# code, and a line may start with the pipe; bash reads both as one chain, and
# it carries a pipe across blank and comment lines too. Comment lines are
# skipped.
#
# What it does not see: `head`, `sed q` or an awk that exits early at the end of
# a pipeline whose status is tested (there were two, felix_overnight_field's
# `cut | head -1` read with `|| return 1` and felix_marketplace_root's
# `sed | sed | head -1` read with `|| mroot=""`, safe only because each reads
# one line, and both now read to the end; a new one would pass this lint); a
# grep whose standard output reaches /dev/null only through a redirect on its
# caller, on a brace group around it, on a subshell that closes on a later line
# (one that closes on grep's own line is named), or through exec; a quoted
# target (`>"/dev/null"`, `>'/dev/null'`); a pipe into
# a brace group or subshell that holds the grep; a grep named by its path or
# through a variable; a wrapper given options of its own (`env -i`,
# `nice -n 5`, `timeout -s KILL 5`); a VAR= prefix whose quoted value holds a
# space; an early option placed after the pattern, or on a continuation line
# inside grep's own arguments; a producer whose status is tested through a
# variable; code built at run time with eval. What it names that is no pipe:
# looking for the pipe and the grep, it reads quoted strings and here-doc
# bodies as code, so a message or a pattern holding `| grep -q` is named, and
# so is the line after a code line whose trailing comment ends in `|`; and
# since grep's command runs past `)` and a lone `&`, a redirect to /dev/null
# that belongs to a later command on the line is named, as is `/dev/nullx`.

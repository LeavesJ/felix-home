printf '\nland table (L2a)\n'
# The landing actor's recipe book, and the two checks that will one day stop a
# landing, before either stops anything. projects/<name>/land.tsv says how each
# path lands: a resolver kind (version-above, keyed-union, insertions-union,
# rerun) is a path the actor may settle without a session, and a narrowing
# kind (session, founder) is one it may not. So the schema refuses a resolver
# on any path whose change is an escape, a commission, an authority grant, an
# exception or the trust base: a table that let the actor settle risk.tsv by
# itself would be a quiet way round everything else in this file. The table is
# read only from refs/remotes/origin/main, because a pull request must not
# rewrite the recipe that lands it, and any change to it escapes to a person.
#
# `owed` and `behind` only report in this step. Each writes a would-refuse row
# to says.log and prints nothing, refuses nothing and moves no exit status, so
# how a session lands is unchanged; a dry run writes nothing at all.
#
# Written blind against the contract (the landing-actor design §4 and §11 step
# 3, through the L2a spec), before the implementation was read. Every positive
# assertion here fails against an engine with no lib/land-table.sh; each
# negative one sits beside a positive sibling in the same fixture. The
# assertions the three reviews added (the exact exemption comparison, every
# says.log row counted, uncommitted and behind owed cases, narrowed, the skip
# pattern and functions from the environment, only 0 writing, the land-table
# row, schema-check) were written by the implementer, not blind. Each was shown
# failing for the reason its name gives: against the unfixed branch engine
# where that engine had the defect, and against a one-line mutation of the
# fixed one where it did not (an extra says.log row, a committed-only or a
# two-dot diff).

printf '\nsort, comm, join and uniq read bytes in the C locale\n'
# The engine runs in its caller's locale, and a macOS Terminal sets
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8, so `felix` run by a person, and every hook of a claude
# started from that Terminal, runs there; a desktop session's tool shell has
# no LANG and runs in C, which is why no session saw any of this. Measured
# 2026-10-08 on macOS 26, bash 3.2.57, /usr/bin/sort 2.3-Apple, at main
# 6fe5f986, two ways it goes wrong:
#
#   - comm compares in the locale's collation, and _felix_escape_shrank hands
#     it two sides _felix_escape_lines sorted in bytes. A row added to a deny
#     table that sorts before an existing row in bytes and after it in the
#     locale (Zulu and _under: en_US.UTF-8 puts punctuation first and folds
#     case) makes comm -23 print a line that was never removed, and a pure
#     addition reads as "the change removes from it", a founder stop.
#   - macOS sort in a UTF-8 locale prints nothing at all when one line is not
#     UTF-8, and says "Illegal byte sequence" on stderr. One Latin-1 byte in a
#     route's play routes no prompt; one in a declared capability makes every
#     detected capability read as undeclared. glibc sort keeps the line, so on
#     Linux the two assertions that measure this pass on the engine as it was
#     and cannot fail there.
#
# The rule they hold the engine to: in runtime code, every sort, comm, join and
# uniq is written `LC_ALL=C <tool>`, on the command itself. The locale is the
# en_US UTF-8 one this machine has, picked as the block above picks it; where
# none is installed, every assertion that needs it is skipped by name. C.UTF-8
# is no substitute: its collation is code-point order, which for valid UTF-8 is
# byte order, so the escape case cannot fail under it. Each locale is set in a
# subshell around the one call under test.

# One call in a chosen locale: C, or `lang` (LANG set and every LC_ unset, as

# The lint. One matcher, _lcb_lint, called by the fixture checks and by the
# check over the real tree, so the real-tree check cannot pass by matching less
# than the fixtures prove it matches. A line is cut into segments at |, ;, &,
# (, ), {, } and the backtick, and each segment's leading words are read off
# until the command: the reserved words and wrappers that put a command after
# them (!, if, then, else, elif, do, while, until, time, eval, env, command,
# exec, nice, nohup, xargs, bash, sh, and a wrapper's -options), assignments,
# a redirection glued to its target, and an opening quote, which is how an awk
# pipe target ("sort"), eval "sort ..." and sh -c 'sort ...' are reached. The
# command counts as the tool by its last path component, with or without a
# leading backslash. A finding is a tool whose last word before it is not
# exactly `LC_ALL=C`, or one reached through env: `LANG=C sort`, `LC_COLLATE=C
# sort` and `env LC_ALL=C sort` are findings, because LANG and LC_COLLATE do
# not override a caller's LC_ALL and the rule names one spelling.
#
# Comment lines are not code. A name directly followed by `(` is an awk
# function call or a definition, never a command. A name that follows a word
# no list above holds is an argument, which is how lib/where-read.sh's awk
# split string stays out. A string that itself holds one of the separators
# right before a tool name reads as a finding, and so does a trailing comment;
# both err toward a finding, and stripping either would let a quote or a #
# inside a string hide a real call behind it.
#
# Still not seen, and checked by hand when the tree is: a wrapper option that
# takes an argument (`nice -n 5 sort`, `env -u X sort`), a redirection apart
# from its target (`> out sort`), and a command inside a heredoc fed to a shell.

printf '\nthe suite is a driver and the parts it sources\n'
# tests/run was one file of 43,000 lines and 2.8 MB until 2026-10-10, and an
# editor's post-edit scanner refused to read it ("request payload exceeded
# maximum size") on every edit. It is a driver now, and the assertions are in
# parts beside it, each cut where it parses alone. Four things keep that cut
# from rotting: a part the driver does not source is a section of the suite
# that never runs, and the manifest would only say so after a full record; a
# part that is not named like the others is skipped by nothing and listed by
# nobody; a part that grows without a cut is the file this replaced; and a
# part that does not parse alone was cut inside a construct.

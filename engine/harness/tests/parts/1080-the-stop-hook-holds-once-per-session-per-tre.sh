# >>> hold-once
printf '\nthe Stop hook holds once per session per tree\n'
# Written blind (slot 2a, part B), from the contract alone. Today the Stop hook
# holds at every unflagged stop of a session whose tree no gate has passed, so
# each idle wake-up of a session on the same unverified tree is held again.
# The rule under test: it is held once per (session id, tree id), and the
# stops after that are debt, not holds. Numbers in the comments are the
# contract's rules.
#
# The fixtures are this block's own, so that nothing an earlier section left
# behind can leak in and the block runs the same cut out and run straight after
# the suite's preamble: a Felix home of its own beside a governed checkout, a
# clean checkout, an ungoverned one, and a second home that is itself the
# checkout it governs (rule 11 is only a question when state/ sits inside the
# tree whose identity is taken). Every hook run goes through one runner that
# kills a run that has not ended in 20 s, so a hang is a failure here and not a
# suite that never ends, and reports what the run printed, how it exited and
# what it added to verification.log.

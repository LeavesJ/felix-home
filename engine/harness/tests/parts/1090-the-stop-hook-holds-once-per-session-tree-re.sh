printf '\nthe Stop hook holds once per session, tree, reason and checkout\n'
# Written blind (slot 2a, part B, the addendum A to I), from the contract alone.
# The first round of this work covers rules 1 to 11: a session is held once per
# tree, and the stops after that are debt. The addendum made the key finer and
# closed the holes an adversarial review found:
#
#   A  a hold is the tree id, the reason and the checkout; debt needs all three
#   B  the same tree with a new reason is held again, once
#   C  a session that holds a night is never let through as debt
#   D  an unborn HEAD and a coarse tree id are held at every stop
#   E  the record is written only after the block JSON has been printed
#   F  a person's prompt clears the record, a runtime message does not
#   G  a link at the record is neither read nor written through
#   H  the debt row names the session by its first eight characters
#   I  the monitor page shows a debt row with the warning class
#
# Every assertion states what the contract says and drives the real hooks. A
# negative ("the stop is held") passes on the code before the change too, since
# that code holds at every stop, so wherever the contract's point is that
# something is NOT debt or NOT recorded, the same assertion also needs the
# counterpart that is debt or is recorded, or it says nothing about the change.
# Where an assertion passes before the change on purpose, because it guards the
# change against over-reaching, its name ends in (control).
#
# The fixtures are this block's own, so that nothing an earlier section left
# behind can leak in and the block runs the same cut out and run straight after
# the suite's preamble: a Felix home of its own with one project, a checkout
# bound to it, a second checkout that stands on the very same commit, a checkout
# with no commit yet and one with more untracked files than a tree id counts.
# Every hook run goes through one runner that kills a run that has not ended in
# 20 s (or the limit a case sets, for the cases that mean to stop a hook), so a
# hang is a failure here and not a suite that never ends.

printf '\ndeclared tools reach, the pulse settings and reach lines, and felix status\n'
# The contract is docs/2026-10-12-declared-tools-reach-spec.md, and these were
# written from it alone, before any of it was built: R1-R12 (reach), P1-P7 (the
# pulse), S1-S11 (felix status). Each name is the sentence it proves. Some hold
# against the engine before this change too, on purpose: they are what the
# spec says must not change (a needs-auth plugin is still present in the plan,
# the pulse runs no claude, felix status writes nothing, unknown never reads as
# ok or zero, a query string is never printed).
#
# Everything lives in one directory of its own: a Felix home, a HOME, a plugin
# cache, a memory root and stubs for claude, launchctl, uname and jq, so no
# assertion here can read or write the machine's own.

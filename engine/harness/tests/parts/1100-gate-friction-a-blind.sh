printf '\ngate friction A: the receipt helpers and the tree id\n'
# Blind, written from contract A alone (docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a.md,
# C4, C5 and C8) on 2026-10-12, before the code it describes existed. Nothing
# here was read off an implementation. tests/receipt.sh is sourced in a child
# bash of its own, as the driver's bash would be, and asked about fixture
# repositories built under $TMP; felix_tree_id is asked through lib/verify.sh,
# sourced in a subshell. An assertion whose name ends in (control) passes on
# the code before the change on purpose: it pins something the contract keeps.
#
# Readings of the contract taken here, where its words allow more than one:
# "git hash-object of $PATH" is taken as the hash of PATH's bytes with or
# without one trailing newline, both accepted; "LC_ALL, else LC_CTYPE, else
# LANG" is asked only with each variable either unset or set to a non-empty
# value; a receipt is "one line" when it holds one newline-ended line.

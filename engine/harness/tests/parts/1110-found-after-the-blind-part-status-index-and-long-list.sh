printf '\nfound after the blind part: felix status and the index, and a long list\n'
# Written by the implementer after the blind part (1100), not blind, for two
# things the blind part did not reach.
#
# The first is felix status and the index. The blind part's S4 assertion runs
# with no receipt, where felix_verify_current answers `none` before it touches
# git. With a green receipt it computes the tree id, which runs `git diff HEAD`,
# and that command rewrites .git/index when a tracked file is only stat-dirty,
# GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0 or not (measured on git 2.54: the variable stops git
# status and not git diff). The gate row must still answer, and the checkout
# must be exactly as it was.
#
# Uses the fixtures part 1100 leaves behind: RXC is a governed checkout, a green
# receipt for its present tree sits in RXH (it reads current), and RXLOG is the
# claude stub's log. The control comes first: the row reads current, so the
# fixture reaches the branch that computes the tree id.

# The second: reach reading a long list. The blind part's lists have six lines.
# The first draft of felix_reach_read took the whitespace out of the list with
# ${body//[ws]/} to see whether anything was left, and on bash 3.2 a global
# substitution over a list this size is quadratic: 100 server lines took 3 s,
# 200 took 17 s and 400 took 100 s, at an ordinary load. This machine's own list
# has about a hundred lines. The bound is generous and still separates the two
# by a factor of ten.

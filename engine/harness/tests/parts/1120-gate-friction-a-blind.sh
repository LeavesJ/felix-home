printf '\ngate friction A: the record run, its receipt and --reuse, in a copy of the driver\n'
# Blind, written from contract A alone (docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a.md,
# C2, C3, C4 and C6) on 2026-10-12, before the code it describes existed. The
# driver under test is this tree's tests/run, copied into a fixture checkout
# with every part line replaced by two tiny parts of this block's own, beside
# this tree's lib and every other file in tests/ but red, which is a stub that
# writes down what it was handed and waits for the mark. The fixture's judge,
# _rt_judge, is a stub too: it skips its four names in record mode, reports
# them otherwise, and fails one of them while a flag file exists. Six runs of
# that driver, in this order, each killed if it has not ended in 60 s:
#   R1  --record-assertions, red there, the judge passing
#   R2  --reuse, on a receipt this block writes, counting no skip
#   R3  --reuse --record-assertions
#   R4  --record-assertions, red not executable, the judge failing
#   R5  --reuse, with no receipt left
#   R6  a red run (FELIX_TEST_NO_MANIFEST=1), the judge failing
# What six runs cannot reach is not asserted here: a failed manifest write
# marked failed, a normal run with no manifest, a tree or an environment that
# moves during a run, a suite with no _rt_judge, and a receipt path that is a
# link when a run ends. An assertion whose name ends in (control) passes on the
# code before the change on purpose: it pins something the contract keeps.

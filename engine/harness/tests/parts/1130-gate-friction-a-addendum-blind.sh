# >>> gate-friction-a-addendum
printf '\ngate friction A, round 2: the addendum, written blind\n'
# Written blind from docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a.md and the ten
# items its second review added (A1 to A10), before any implementation of them
# and without reading one. What each block asks:
#
#   A1  the receipt names origin/main as the run began, is written only when
#       origin/main is the same at the end, and _sr_check refuses a receipt
#       whose origin/main moved, before its 12-hour check
#   A2  a run that may leave a receipt removes the old one before its first part
#   A3  a log that holds the reuse line, pushed off its first line by stderr,
#       is never the tests check's ok
#   A4  a root that is not its own top level is no checkout
#   A5  red, started by the record run, is not a job a part's bare wait waits for
#   A6  a mark that cannot be written ends red and red's suite at once
#   A7  red notices, while its suite runs, that its record run is gone
#   A8  a process that is not red's parent never extends red's wait
#   A9  a mark that is not a regular file is refused without being opened
#   A10 the summary line is the last line, whatever the receipt does
#
# Three runs of a copy of this driver (its prelude, one stub part, its end) in
# a fixture checkout under $TMP: a normal run that should leave a receipt, a
# record run during which origin/main appears, and a record run whose mark
# cannot be written. Red is asked directly, beside a stub suite, for A7 to A9,
# and the gate beside a stub suite for A3.
#
# Readings chosen where the text leaves room. The receipt's field for
# origin/main has no stated position, so it is looked for as a whole field and
# the receipt is aged by moving every field that is one of the run's times.
# A7's half about a signal to the record run is asked of red alone: a fourth
# driver run is over this block's budget, and red seeing its record run gone
# is what ends red's suite within seconds either way. A8's "no longer the
# process that started red" is read to cover a pid that never was red's
# parent. A3 asks only that such a log is not ok, since what the gate says
# instead (fail, or reused when its own signal says so) is not fixed. A4's
# "no run writes or removes a receipt for such a root" is asked of the
# helpers the driver goes through, not of a run.

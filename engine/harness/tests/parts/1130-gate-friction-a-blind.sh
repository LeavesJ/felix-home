printf '\ngate friction A: the gate reads a reused suite run\n'
# Blind, written from contract A alone (docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a.md,
# C7) on 2026-10-12, before the code it describes existed. projects/felix/gate.sh
# is copied from this tree into a fixture checkout and run whole, standing in
# it. Every other check the gate makes can be satisfied or skipped there: a
# schema-check and an independence-scan that pass, a capability probe naming
# one word that nothing else names, no plugin cache (installed is skipped), and
# no scanner for the checks that announce a skip. So the gate's own verdict is
# the tests check's, and engine/harness/tests/run is a stub that writes down
# the arguments it was given and prints the log a mode file names. A run of the
# gate is killed if it has not ended in 30 s. An assertion whose name ends in
# (control) passes on the code before the change on purpose: it pins what the
# contract keeps as it is today.

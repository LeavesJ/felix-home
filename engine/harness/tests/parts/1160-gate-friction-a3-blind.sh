printf '\ngate friction A3: a suite run stands across the one commit that records it (blind)\n'
# Blind, written from contract A3 alone (audits/2026-10-12-gate-friction/
# CONTRACT-A3.md, rule C10) on 2026-10-12, before the code it describes
# existed. Nothing here was read off an implementation of it. tests/receipt.sh
# is sourced in a child bash of its own and asked about fixture repositories
# under $TMP, as parts 1100 and 1120 ask it; `tests/run --reuse` is this tree's
# driver copied into one of them, with its part lines replaced by one stub
# part that says it ran and exits 3, beside this tree's receipt.sh and lib.
# Each receipt here is written by this block with the tree id, environment and
# origin/main that receipt.sh's own helpers give for the state the "run" left.
# An assertion whose name ends in (control) passes on the code before the
# change on purpose: it pins something the contract keeps as it is today.
#
# Readings of the contract taken here: "the parent is an ancestor of the
# recorded origin/main" includes the parent being that commit itself, as git
# merge-base --is-ancestor says; and the seven-field line's seventh field is
# HEAD's full 40-digit sha.

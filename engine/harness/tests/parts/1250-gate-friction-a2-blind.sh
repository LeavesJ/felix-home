printf '\na reused tests verdict merges only on a green CI gate (contract A2, blind)\n'
# Written from docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a2.md alone, C9.1 to
# C9.5. felix-home has no branch protection and `felix merge` asks CI nothing:
# its boundary is the receipt. Contract A lets the receipt's tests verdict come
# from a reused suite run (`tests:reused` in the sixth field), so a merge on
# such a receipt also needs the gate workflow to have passed on the exact head.
#
# Everything here is this part's own: a project, a checkout, a stub gh first
# on PATH that records every call and answers from a file, and nothing that
# reaches a network. The checkout's origin names github.com so a slug can be
# read from it, and GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL keeps git itself from ever going there.
# The judge is loaded the way the merge boundary loads it for felix-home
# (_felix_kernel_blockers): six libraries, set -uo pipefail, a child bash.

# tests/run, as part 1130 does it. The stub writes `warning: something` to
# stderr with no newline ahead of the suite's first line, which is what a git
# warning or BASH_ENV can do: the log then holds the sentence on a line that
# does not begin with it. A gate that reports ok for it writes tests:ok in its
# receipt and C9 asks nothing.

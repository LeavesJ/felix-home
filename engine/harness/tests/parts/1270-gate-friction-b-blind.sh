printf '\ngate friction B: the slow assertions (contract B, blind)\n'
# Blind, written from docs/2026-10-13-gate-friction-contract-b.md alone on
# 2026-10-13, before the code it describes existed. Nothing here was read off
# an implementation of it.
#
# B1 and B2 change parts 0580, 0900 and 0920, which run before this one in the
# same shell. B1 is asserted by running the 0580 block again, cut out of the
# part between its own comment and the next heading, with this part's own
# ok/bad/is/has/skip, so its verdicts are read here and counted nowhere else.
# A claude this part writes stands first on PATH beneath the block, and logs
# any call that reaches it: the block's own stub must stand in front of it. B2
# is asserted on the gh stub part 0900 wrote and on _ibsig itself.
#
# B3 (qualify rows in parallel) was cut from this PR after review, with its
# assertions: rows running at once share the repository's worktree list, and a
# column's git read while another row adds or removes its worktree fails with
# 128, which can turn a verdict. It goes back to its contract as a PR of its
# own (branch claude/gf-b3).

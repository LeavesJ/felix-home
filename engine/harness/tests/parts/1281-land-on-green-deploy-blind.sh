printf '\nland on green: deploy what main holds, and install the job (contract G3, G7, G9, blind)\n'
# Blind, written from docs/2026-10-15-land-on-green-contract.md alone on
# 2026-10-15, with part 1280, on the fixture 1280 builds. Nothing here was read
# off an implementation.
#
# A deploy is made owed by taking main's entry out of the cache, by putting a
# stray file in it, or by pushing a newer version to origin/main. The home's
# felix stub answers install by copying the home's engine/harness into the
# cache under the version the home declares, so a deploy that pulls before it
# installs leaves the new version there. "A gate is running" is a line in
# ctl/procs that the pgrep stub matches with grep -E. The contract does not say
# whether a tick that completes an owed deploy goes on to merge in the same
# tick, so the deploy scenarios list no pull request where that would matter.

# a land/verifying left in place stands for all three.
#
# main's engine gains two lines in its felix stub here, committed and pushed,
# so every cache entry after it carries them: gate logs whether land/verifying
# exists while it runs, and land execs ctl/land.exec when that file is there,
# which is how the trampoline is made to run a tick that cannot resolve its
# project (A22).

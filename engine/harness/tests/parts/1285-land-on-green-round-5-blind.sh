# A25 through A28's seam. A copy of the CLI beside it sets _GT_WDSECS=2 on the
# line after it sources lib/green-tick.sh. Its tick runs in a process group of
# its own and is held in gh auth status by a gh that, on TERM, logs it and
# exits 0, as a passing auth would. A tick still unsignalled when that gh ends
# would go on to list pull requests; one already holding its TERM writes its
# timeout row instead. That is how "the tick's pid first" is read. A sentinel
# joins the tick's process group without descending from it: a TERM to that
# group reaches it. pgrep is the system's for this tick, so a watchdog that
# finds descendants with it finds real ones. A watchdog that signalled its own
# pid ahead of gh would not live to reach gh; one that signals itself after its
# last descendant leaves no mark a test here can read.

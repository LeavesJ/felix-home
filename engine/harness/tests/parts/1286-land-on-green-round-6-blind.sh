printf '\nland on green: the amendment A29 (contract A29, blind)\n'
# Blind, from the contract's "Amended after the record of 2026-10-16" alone, on
# the fixture parts 1280-1285 build: lib/resolve.sh, lib/green-tick.sh,
# lib/green-install.sh and the felix CLI were not read. main's check is run as
# 1282's _la_accepts runs it, and the tick as every land part runs it.
#
# The race is made certain, not likely. A git first on PATH runs the real git
# for everything but archive. For archive it writes the real archive, waits
# half a second, then writes git's trailing padding again: zero bytes, 1 MiB of
# them, more than any pipe holds. A reader that reads to the end takes them and
# the write succeeds. A reader that stopped at the end-of-archive marker has
# left, or leaves while the write is blocked, and the write dies of SIGPIPE
# whatever the timing. The stub's status is that write's, as a real git
# archive's would be. Given -o FILE (or --output), it appends the padding to
# FILE, where no race exists. ctl/archive.fail makes it fail instead: exit 128
# after writing nothing ("nothing") or the archive's first 1024 bytes ("part").
# Each archive call is logged to log/archive.log as where<TAB>mode.

printf '\nland on green: the amendment A31 (contract A31, blind)\n'
# Blind, from the contract's "Amended after install, 2026-10-18" alone, on the
# fixture parts 1280-1287 build: lib/green-install.sh, lib/green-tick.sh,
# lib/resolve.sh and the felix CLI were not read. The trampoline is run as
# launchd runs it: an empty environment but HOME, FELIX_HOME_DIR and PATH, from
# a directory that is not the home.
#
# macOS's privacy control cannot be summoned from a fixture, so the open A31
# asks for is failed another way, one where [ -r ] still says yes:
#   - a unix socket named plugin.json: [ -r ] passes and open(2) is refused.
#     This is the case that follows the contract to the letter (an open that
#     fails). It needs perl to bind the socket, and skips without it.
#   - a directory named plugin.json: [ -r ] passes, bash can open it for
#     reading, and only a read of it fails. So this case holds only for a
#     trampoline that reads a byte, not one that merely opens.
#   - a file of mode 000, when the suite is not root.
# A git first on the trampoline's PATH logs each call and runs the real one, so
# "before anything else" can be seen: an unopenable file leaves it no call to
# make. It sits ahead of the stubs only for the trampoline, never for felix land.

printf '\ngate friction C: the suite reads tests/lib, and nothing in it runs when sourced (blind)\n'
# Blind, written on 2026-10-16 from contract C alone (docs/2026-10-16-gate-
# friction-contract-c.md, C2 and C3) and the interface decided for it, before
# any implementation existed. Nothing here was read off one. The interface:
#
# - tests/run sources every tests/lib/*.sh by one line, . "$HERE/lib/NAME.sh",
#   in LC_ALL=C name order, all of them between the line sourcing
#   parts/0005-fixture-floor.sh and the line sourcing parts/0010-resolution.sh,
#   and no line names a file that is not there;
# - _suite_files, in the driver or a prelude part, prints the path of the
#   driver, of every tests/parts/*.sh and of every tests/lib/*.sh, one a line,
#   and nothing else;
# - _suite_src prints the text of every part, every lib file and the driver;
#   _suite_flat gives the driver with each part line and each lib line
#   replaced by the text of the file it names;
# - _lib_runs_nothing FILE sources FILE in a subshell, in a scratch directory
#   standing in for $TMP, with TMP, FROOT, MEM and REPO pointed under it, and
#   returns 0 only when that printed nothing, created, changed or removed
#   nothing under the scratch directory and left PASS, FAIL and SKIP as they
#   were; otherwise 1, with one line naming FILE and what it did.
#
# Readings taken where the interface leaves room. The lib-line check below is
# this part's own function, run on the real driver and on planted copies of it,
# so a planted copy proves the same code bites. A lib line is one whole line of
# exactly that form; any other spelling is not a line for the file. Paths
# _suite_files prints are compared as files, with their directories resolved
# physically, in no particular order. A copy of the tree is pointed at the way
# _suite_src and _suite_flat read today, HERE and REAL_HARNESS both, in a
# subshell with a TMP of its own, so _suite_flat's cache under $TMP is the
# copy's and not this run's. Each planted file for _lib_runs_nothing does one
# thing, silently where the thing is not printing, so it is caught for that
# thing: the ok case's output is thrown away, so only PASS can give it away.
# Its git init goes through _fx_git, as every fixture git write does, so it
# runs only where the scratch directory lies below a fixture root such as
# $TMP; elsewhere _fx_git refuses it, the record makes the run's end red, and
# the case reads as not caught. Those calls run in a subshell of this part's
# whose FELIX_TEST_RAN is a sink of its own, so a planted ok never reaches the
# run's list of names.
#
# Before the implementation, the lib-line checks pass (the real tree has no
# lib and no lib line, and the planted copies test this part's own check); the
# rest FAIL, and the check of the real lib files skips, saying there are none.
#
# Amended 2026-10-16, blind again, from an amended interface, after a reviewer
# found how much a lib file can do at source time that the judge missed. It
# replaces the _lib_runs_nothing bullet above and adds the rest:
# - _lib_runs_nothing FILE judges FILE in a new /bin/bash --noprofile --norc,
#   under env -i with only PATH, and HOME, TMPDIR, TMP, FROOT, MEM, REPO,
#   FELIX_HOME and FELIX in a fresh scratch directory under $TMP, with set -u
#   and pipefail. 0 only when every command run while sourcing is a plain
#   assignment (NAME=VALUE words only, no $( , backtick, <( or >( in a value;
#   a function definition runs none), nothing was printed, nothing under the
#   scratch directory was created, changed or removed, and the shell did not
#   end before the source returned. Otherwise 1, and one line naming FILE and
#   the first thing it did;
# - the driver writes $TMP/lib-before.names at the start of its lib block,
#   after the 0005 line and before its first lib line, or the 0010 line when
#   it has none: every variable and function name defined there, one a line;
# - _lib_clashes prints NAME<TAB>LIBFILE<TAB>WHAT for a name a lib file
#   assigns or defines that lib-before.names holds (WHAT: defined before the
#   lib block), and for a function a lib file defines that another file of
#   _suite_files defines too (WHAT: that file's path); nothing when none. A
#   variable a later part sets too is no clash.
# Readings. (e) gains one assertion a hole, named for what the planted file
# does. Three holes are names, not commands, and go to _lib_clashes. Each new
# judge call runs in a subshell with HOME, TMPDIR, FELIX_HOME and FELIX under
# $GCI, so a judge that leaves one alone lets the write land there, outside
# its scratch directory and still inside $TMP; the guarded build runs with its
# guard exported as set, as a lib block that built it leaves it. (g) plants its
# clashes and (e)'s three in the copy (c) made, each with its lib line, and runs
# _lib_clashes there once, with a TMP holding this run's lib-before.names;
# paths are compared as files. (h) reads "the line that writes" as the one
# driver line outside a comment that names lib-before.names. Before the
# amended implementation most hole cases, (g) and (h) FAIL.
#
# Amended again 2026-10-16, a third round, blind, after two reviews of the
# judges found a lib file could still weaken the serial run. C2 now reads: a
# lib file, sourced, defines functions and nothing else; it runs no command and
# sets no variable, not even a plain assignment. It replaces both judges'
# bullets above:
# - _lib_runs_nothing FILE judges FILE in a new /bin/bash --noprofile --norc
#   under env -i, with PATH, and HOME, TMPDIR, TMP, FROOT, MEM, REPO,
#   FELIX_HOME and FELIX in a fresh scratch directory under $TMP; set -u,
#   pipefail, extdebug and a DEBUG trap that records each command and skips it;
#   a 10 s limit. 0 only when no command was recorded, nothing was printed,
#   nothing under the scratch directory changed, the child's variable names
#   are the same after sourcing as before, and it ended normally within the
#   limit; otherwise 1, and one line naming FILE and the first thing it did;
# - _lib_clashes takes a lib file's names from a judging child (the functions
#   it holds after sourcing and not before) and prints NAME<TAB>LIBFILE<TAB>WHAT
#   for each that lib-before.names holds (defined before the lib block), that
#   is a builtin, keyword, alias or command on PATH (a builtin, a keyword, an
#   alias, or the command's path), that another lib file defines, or that
#   another file of _suite_files defines by its text (that file's path).
# Readings. Each assertion that passed a plain assignment now refuses it, on
# the same planted file. A clash case that sets a variable is refused by
# _lib_runs_nothing, and _lib_clashes, naming functions only, prints no line
# for it. A builtin's WHAT is "a builtin"; git's is the path type -P finds here,
# on the PATH the judge is handed. Files both judges must pass are planted in
# the copy with function names made at run time, so no file of the tree holds
# their definitions. Every _gci_judge call runs under ulimit -t 20, so a judge
# with no limit of its own meets the endless loop as a FAIL, not a hang; that
# case also times the call and allows the 10 s limit and 10 s more. (h) reads
# "a function that part 0006 defines" as the two judges, each defined by a line
# of 0006 at its left margin. Before the third-round judges, most new cases FAIL.

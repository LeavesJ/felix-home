# >>> gate-friction-d-shell-blind
printf '\ngate friction D: the shell a unit leaves for the parts after it (blind, revision 12)\n'
# Blind, written from contract D revision 9 alone (docs/2026-10-18-gate-friction-contract-d.md: D3, D8, R8, R12, R16, R24, R28), with R31 of revision 10, R38 of revision 11 and R41 and R42 (e) of revision 12 added. Nothing here was read off an
# implementation; tests/run is run, never read, in copies of this suite that _suite_copy_tree (part 0003) makes under $TMP, each with planted parts of
# this block's own. Every case points TMPDIR at a fixture directory, runs every inner run under a bounded runner that makes its own process group and
# resets HUP and TERM, and ends by asking that group to hold no live process, stopped or running (zombies aside), for 30 s; what is left is named,
# then sent CONT and KILL by pid. Nothing is killed by pattern: a sleeper a planted part leaves is ended by the pid it wrote down.
# The planted parts are one set, each doing one thing to the shell and then printing its own ok line. They are numbered so that the ones that spoil
# the shell for what follows (a closed descriptor, a disabled printf or enable, a removed EXIT trap) come last, so a -j 1 run reaches every one.
# Four kinds: x leaves the shell changed (the seventh failure under -j 3, none under -j 1); p passes; s is skipped; j is a part that is only judged
# under -j 3 and left out of the -j 1 run, since a function that forwards nothing (perl() { :; }) would break the parts after it there (R28); c is a
# part that only the -j 1 run holds, a control (a function that forwards, which R28 no longer counts as a case of the seventh failure).
# Names say the clause: R8 the first comparison, R16 what it was widened to, R24 every builtin's status, aliases and readonly functions, R28 the
# shadows that forward nothing, the watched variables, a trap removed and a group. Each change line is the one the contract gives, as written.
# R41: every nested run has a stand-in mktemp first on PATH (mk/mktemp): given no template argument it passes the same options and the template "$TMPDIR/tmp.XXXXXXXXXX" to the
# host's mktemp, so a nested run's $TMP is made below the case's fixture directory even on macOS, whose mktemp -d ignores TMPDIR, and it logs each path it made to mktemp.log.
# The closing assertions say that the log is not empty (the stand-in was reached) and that every path in it is under this part's own case directories.
# R42 (e), after R38, with R44: red's suite runs this part on the base's tests/red and tests/receipt.sh, which lack R1's stopper, so the record run's exit with a runner failure is, there, only
# after red's suite has ended by itself, and what is left of red's tree then is a matter of timing. The record run therefore gives red's suite (DJX_HOLD names hold.pl, for that run
# alone, and DJX_LIM the case's run bound B, 240 s, the same as _db5_lim) a red-only holder H, planted in the last part that fails (the line sits before its change): where FELIX_TEST_NO_MANIFEST=1 the part makes the case's hold.dir (only the first
# to do so goes on), starts H (a process that ends within 0.2 s of hold.release appearing, and on its own only once B + 30 s have passed since it started),
# writes hold.pid and hold.start and waits until hold.go exists, for B at most (without it, it goes on all the same, R46), and C = 10 s more; in the record run the same part waits for hold.start (B at most; if it never came it writes no hold.go, R46)
# and writes hold.go. That part is the last to start in the record run, so its failure comes a second or two after hold.go (DJX_MLOG, when it names a file, logs the measure): against D's build red's monitor ends red's suite on the failed mark while the step holds,
# H with it, and nothing of red's tree is left when the record run exits; against a build without R1 red's suite goes on after C and ends by itself, leaving H running, and the
# name fails on every run. _db5_run writes hold.release as soon as _db5_atexit has listed, before _db5_clean. The step is one perl process (no short-lived child to be left behind).
# R44: no bound of a hold is shorter than the case's own run bound, and a hold that did not happen fails R1's name on either build: R46: _db5_hv gives R1's verdict on a record half that holds, ok only when hold.start exists (else "red's suite never reached its hold"), hold.go exists (else "the record run never reached its hold"), the run did not end at its bound (exit 124: "the run reached its bound") and the listings at the exit find nothing, the first that fails giving the got. hold.miss and hold.nogo are not written: run.pl's KILL at B comes before either could be. DJX_MLOG's line for a case that held also gives, in ms from the run's start (_db5_start writes it to run.start), the times to hold.start, to hold.go and to the exit.
# An assertion whose name ends in (control) passes before D is built on purpose.

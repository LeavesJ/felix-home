# >>> stuck-pr-page-last-ledger-row
printf '\nthe stuck-PR page: the lander source row ends with the newest ledger row, and --status names the same row (spec v2 R11, blind)\n'
# Blind, written on 2026-10-18 from spec v2 amendment R11 and section 4.3, 5, 6
# and R8 (audits/2026-10-01-report-v5-review/specs/stuck-pr/spec-v2.md) and from
# A31's wording of the --status last line (docs/2026-10-15-land-on-green-
# contract.md), without reading lib/pr-status*.sh, lib/green-tick.sh or
# lib/green-install.sh. Parts 1300 to 1350 were read only for how their
# fixtures and stubs are built. Self-contained after the preamble: it builds
# its own fixture under $TMP and removes it.
#
# What R11 fixes, and what these assertions pin:
#   the lander source row's detail ends "; last ledger row <time> <event>:
#   <detail>", from the ledger's newest (last) line whatever its PR column;
#   time is column 1, event column 2, detail column 7; a carriage return in the
#   detail is a space; a missing column is empty. With the ledger row "none" it
#   ends "; last ledger row none"; with it "unread", "; last ledger row not
#   read". It comes after installed, loaded, paused and any paused reason. The
#   row's state (live or not-live) and every pull request's state are unchanged.
#   R8's filter covers the detail. --status keeps its last line and names the
#   same row.
# What R11 leaves open, and these assertions leave open too: the separator
# between installed, loaded, paused and the reason; how the text page lays the
# lander row out (a text assertion only asks that the page holds the clause);
# whether a clause with an empty detail keeps a trailing space after the colon
# (those assertions trim trailing spaces); what an event or time holding a
# control byte shows (only the detail is pinned); and a row with more than seven
# columns.
#
# The fixture: two bare origins whose paths end github.com/fixture/home.git and
# two.git, so the slugs are fixture/home and fixture/two, and a clone of the first
# that is also the Felix home, holding projects/felix (remote_match
# github.com/fixture/home) and projects/two (remote_match github.com/fixture/two).
# two is a clone with a pushed main. gh and launchctl are stubs first on PATH,
# each logging its argv. gh answers pr list from ctl/prs.<owner>_<name>.json, the
# repository taken from -R or --repo, else from the origin of the directory it
# runs in, and answers the Actions billing GET and a GET of repos/fixture/<x>
# with the default branch, main. launchctl print always fails (the job is not
# loaded). Memory is a fixture directory, so each project's land/ directory is
# $SNM/<p>/land. HOME is a fixture directory on every run.

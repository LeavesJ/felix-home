printf '\njudge refs and residue: felix merge refuses a base it cannot resolve by full name (contract A12, blind)\n'
# Blind, from item A12 of docs/2026-10-18-judge-refs-residue-contract.md and
# the coordinator's cases for it. Not read: lib/resolve.sh, lib/exceptions.sh,
# the merge body of the felix CLI, and projects/felix/gate.sh. The merge is
# driven as part 1400's A9 drives it (0340's self-governed shape). The phrase
# "full ref name" is the coordinator's wording for case 3. This part builds
# its own fixture and project, jr12, and removes both at its end.
#
# The checkout: m0 (this tree's engine, 1.0.0) <- m1 (main, and
# refs/remotes/origin/main) <- the prose branch, checked out. d1 is off m1, and
# its resolve.sh defines a felix_accepted_deploy_diff that writes a line to
# $J12/decoy-ran, prints the entry and exits 0; d2 is a child of d1. The cache
# entry for 1.0.0 is cut from m1, so with a base read by full name every dry
# run below passes the judge, and the only thing a case changes is --base.

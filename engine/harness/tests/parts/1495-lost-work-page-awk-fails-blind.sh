printf '\nthe lost-work page, step 6: when the page awk fails, exit 1 and the repository named (contract B8 as amended 2026-10-19, B9.41, blind)\n'
# Written blind on 2026-10-19 from docs/2026-10-18-lost-work-page-contract.md
# alone (B4, B5, B6, B8 as amended 2026-10-19, B9.41), on the stubs, builders
# and run helpers in tests/lib/lost-work.sh. No line of the page's code was read.
#
# Two fixture repositories, awa (A) and awb (B), each _lw_repo's clone of a bare
# origin with main pushed, no project governing them and no pull requests. Every
# run passes --no-host and --no-gh: no host record and no gh answer is read, so
# the runs are cheap, and two runs over the same repository seconds apart print
# the same bytes (the sessions and prs cover rows read unknown the same way each
# time, and age_h is the floor of whole hours, 0 for commits made here). That is
# what lets B9.41 compare the A-then-B page with B's page byte for byte.
#
# Three awk stubs, each in a directory of its own put first on PATH around the
# runs that use it, each ending in the real awk, whose path is taken with
# command -v before PATH changes:
#   one    exits 2 when an argument begins order=, else runs the real awk (B9.41);
#   first  does that for the first order= call it sees only, a marker directory
#          under this part's own temporary directory recording that it has (B9.41);
#   late   for an order= call runs the real awk, so the page's rows are printed,
#          and then exits 2 (B8: not even what the awk printed before it stopped).

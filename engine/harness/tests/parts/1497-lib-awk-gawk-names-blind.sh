# Written blind on 2026-10-19 from docs/2026-10-18-lost-work-page-contract.md
# alone: B12's "Tests" items 1 to 6, which B9.42 points at. _awk_names is
# defined in tests/lib/awk-names.sh, which did not exist when this was written;
# every run below goes through _an97_run, which records a status of "undefined"
# when the function is not there, so each assertion still runs and fails.
#
# A run's rows are read as B12's output table gives them: name FILE LINE IDENT,
# unread FILE LINE WHAT, open FILE LINE WHAT, then programs N last. WHAT is free
# text, so an unread or open row is compared on its kind, file and line only.
# Each fixture below is its own file under this part's temporary directory and
# its own run, so a row can only come from the form that fixture holds; FILE is
# the path as given, and every path given here is absolute. input.txt and the
# other files the fixtures name are never read: the lint reads text and runs
# nothing.

printf '\nwhat the engine reads from a patch is the repository'"'"'s, not a diff setting'"'"'s\n'
# Written blind, from the contract alone and before any implementation existed:
# "what the engine reads from a patch is the repository's, not a diff setting's"
# (felix-home, 2026-10-08, for claude/no-diff-drivers-in-parsed-diffs, stacked on
# claude/git-reads-fail-closed, ccb88d1d and then 34a1bc3a). Four readers parse
# or hash what porcelain `git diff` prints: secret-scan (S), felix_added_lines
# (A), _felix_escape_confined (C) and felix_tree_id (T). Porcelain diff hands the
# patch to an external diff or a driver's command when the repository names one,
# prints a textconv's output in place of the file, prints "Binary files differ"
# for a text file marked -diff, binary or binary=true or over
# core.bigFileThreshold, and names paths under whatever prefix and relative
# setting the configuration gives. On the stacked base each of those reaches the
# readers: a branch that commits a .gitattributes saying `*.txt -diff` blinds
# its own scan. The rule: what the readers read is the repository's content, and
# no setting moves it. The clause each assertion serves is named at its end in
# the contract's letters (D drivers, B binary marking, P paths, U a scan that
# could not read, N what does not move, L the lint). Those marked "as today" and
# the N1 controls pass on the stacked base by design, as the behaviour that must
# not move. Those marked (rule) go past the lettered clauses to the rule they
# serve: color.ui or color.diff set to always, and rename detection, each change
# what porcelain diff prints for a line the branch adds, and no clause names them;
# and under a driver, a floor raised in place is read as the confined change it
# is, which D4 alone would let a reader refuse by firing on every change.
#
# Every setting sits in the fixture repository's own config, its attribute in
# .git/info/attributes or in a .gitattributes the branch commits, or, for
# GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, in the environment of the one call, so
# a case means the same on a runner whose global config is empty. Each fixture is
# a repository of its own under one directory; every git call there stands below
# it with GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES at it. A setting git turns out not to apply is
# a FAIL naming it, since a case it leaves untouched tests nothing, except a
# prefix setting older git does not know, which is a skip. Keys are assembled at
# run time, so this file never carries one. Every reader call runs under a time
# limit that is a guard against a hang, not a measurement.

# -c <key=value>, --no-pager, --git-dir=..., --work-tree=...), then the word
# diff and a blank or the end of the line; one that also carries --name-only or
# --name-status is exempt. Prints file:line for each offender, relative to the
# directory, and returns 1; 0 when there is none, 2 when there is no engine.
# Widened after review (2026-10-08): any long global option may stand before

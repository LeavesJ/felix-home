# The suite's receipt: what a run that reached its end leaves behind, and what a
# later run reads before it pays for the suite again.
#
# Sourced by tests/run, and sourceable on its own. It needs bash 3.2, git and
# ../lib/verify.sh, which it loads inside a subshell each time it asks for a
# tree id, so the shell that sources this file gains no felix_verify_* name and
# no FELIX_UNTRACKED_CAP. The driver is 500 lines at most (part 1040), and this
# is where the receipt's rules live so that the driver only decides when to ask.
#
# Why it exists. An engine change paid for the whole suite three times before
# it landed: the record run, the red run the record run then made, and the
# gate. Measured on a quiet machine on 2026-10-10 the suite was 1429 s of the
# gate's 1565 s (audits/2026-10-10-gate-time). The record run and red now run
# side by side, and the third pass is the gate's `tests` check asking this file
# whether the tree it is about to gate is one a run already passed. The design
# is docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-design.md, section 3; the rules are
# docs/2026-10-12-gate-friction-contract-a.md, C4 and C5, and, for the one commit
# that records a run, contract-a3.md, C10 (_sr_bridge).
#
# One receipt for each checkout, one line, tab-separated, in the checkout's git
# directory (git rev-parse --git-path), which is outside the tree: writing it
# moves no tree id. A linked worktree has a git directory of its own, so it has
# a receipt of its own. A root that is not the top of its own checkout (a
# directory inside a larger repository, such as the plugin cache under a home
# directory in git) is no checkout here: its tree id would be the larger one's,
# blind to what that directory holds, and its receipt path would be shared by
# every directory under it.
#
#   v1  <tree id>  <mode>  <passed>  <failed>  <skipped>  <env>  <start>  <end>
#
# <mode> is normal or record; <start> and <end> are Unix seconds. <env> is
# _sr_env, and, when the checkout had a refs/remotes/origin/main, that line
# followed by ;origin=<the commit it named when the run began>. A checkout with
# none writes <env> as _sr_env alone, which reads as "none" (a `-`).
#
# A run that may leave a receipt takes the last one away before its first part
# (_rcp_begin), so the only receipt that can stand after it is one it wrote
# itself at its end. A run that fails, is interrupted or dies part way never
# leaves an earlier pass standing for the gate to find.
#
# What a receipt names, and what it does not. The tree id covers every tracked
# and untracked file under the root and the commit HEAD names. The assertions
# also read things the tree does not hold. The receipt names these: the host,
# the bash version, the locale, the PATH (by hash), whether a `claude` CLI is on
# it (some assertions turn into skips), and the commit refs/remotes/origin/main
# names (part 1010's judge reads it: _rtn3 and _rtn4 compare this tree with it,
# so a fetch that moves it can turn a pass into a fail with the tree unchanged).
# A receipt refuses with `origin/main moved` when that commit is not the one
# recorded, or cannot be read while one was.
# Everything else is covered by the twelve-hour bound alone, and is not named:
#  - the memory root's lessons.md, read from ~/.felix/memory/felix by part 0590;
#  - the plugin install state: what `claude plugin list --json` answers (the
#    engine_deployed obligation reads it through felix_deployed_engine, part
#    0440) and the deployed plugin cache and marketplace registry under
#    ~/.claude/plugins, which the gate's `installed` check and the readers in
#    parts 0110, 0430, 0590 and 0800 consult wherever a test is not handed a
#    cache of its own; the receipt names only whether `claude` is on PATH;
#  - the user's real HOME where the suite does not set one: ~/.felix-home, the
#    Claude settings directory, the global git configuration and its global
#    excludes file (the driver's own comments record the last one);
#  - the version of git and of the other tools on PATH, which the path hash
#    names only as a path;
#  - the machine: its load, clock, process cap, free disk and network, which the
#    timing-bound assertions and the ones that fork heavily answer to;
#  - gh and the network, where an assertion is not given a stub of its own.
# A change to any of those rides on a receipt for up to twelve hours.
#
# What a receipt cannot say, plainly. It is a file a session can write, as the
# gate's own receipt is that `felix merge` already trusts. Reuse adds no new
# kind of trust, and GitHub CI still runs the whole suite on Linux before
# anything merges. What it does refuse is the honest mistakes: a tree that
# moved, a run that failed, a different bash, a different host, a `claude` CLI
# that turns skips into passes or back, a main that moved, a receipt older than
# twelve hours.

# The bridged tree id (rule C10, contract A3, 2026-10-12): the id of the tree a
# receipt names, asked of a checkout that has been committed since. PR A's reuse
# never fired in the one flow it was built for. A record run ends with the
# manifest and red.tsv changed and not committed; the landing order is record,
# commit, gate, because the gate's receipt and `felix merge` judge the tree that
# is pushed; and the commit moves HEAD, which the tree id hashes, so the gate
# found `another tree` and ran the whole suite again. The content the gate would
# test was byte for byte the content the run passed, and only the commit naming
# it was new. So where HEAD has exactly one parent, the id is asked as it would
# be if HEAD named that parent: the diff of the working tree against the parent,
# the same untracked files, the same hash (felix_tree_id_on, one code path with
# felix_tree_id). A root commit, an unborn HEAD and a merge have no bridged id.
#
# It stands only if the receipt's tree id is that id, which says the parent is the
# commit the run had at HEAD and the working tree holds, against it, what the run
# left. A file the run saw untracked and the commit added is tracked now, so the
# ids differ and the suite runs: stricter than it need be, and meant to be. And
# only if the parent is not an ancestor of the commit the receipt recorded for
# origin/main (`-` holds nothing back). Part 1010's judge asks what a committed
# tree is asked (merge-base and ancestry against origin/main, _rtn3 and _rtn4)
# only of a tree that holds a commit origin/main lacks, and skips both for one
# whose HEAD origin/main already held; a run at such a parent was not asked what
# the commit is. Searched on 2026-10-12 (the parts, the driver, red, this file):
# no other read of the checkout's git state has an answer the commit changes,
# apart from `merge-base HEAD origin/main` choosing between two equally good
